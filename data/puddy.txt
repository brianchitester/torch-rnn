PUDDY: (off camera) Since I was a kid, I'm from Jersey.
PUDDY: Hey, no way, man.
PUDDY: We're primed.
PUDDY: So what do you think?
PUDDY: I painted my face.
PUDDY: Yeah.
PUDDY: You know, support the team.
PUDDY: Why not?
PUDDY: Hey, you gotta let them know you're out there, this is the playoffs.
PUDDY: Hey.
PUDDY: Ok, ready to go?
PUDDY: (startlingly loud) LET'S GET IT ON!!! Alright!! Go Devils!! Go Devils!! Let's go Devils!!
PUDDY: You're dead, Messier! We're gonna get you, Messier!
PUDDY: Hey man, I'm just trying to support the team.
PUDDY: Oh yeah, because you're a Ranger fan and you know I'm messing with their heads.
PUDDY: Go Devils!!
PUDDY: Ha ha! We took it to you! You couldn't get it out of your zone all night. We were aggressive, we didn't let you penetrate!
PUDDY: (pounding the hood) Hey, what are you doing?! Watch where you're driving, man! (He approaches the passenger side window) Don't mess with the Devils, buddy. We're number one, we beat anybody! We're the Devils! The Devils!! Haaaa!!!
PUDDY: Hey, great dip. You made this?
PUDDY: Oh. Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner? Why is it only a snack, why can't it be a meal, you know? I don't understand stuff like that.
PUDDY: Alright, that's cool.
PUDDY: You gotta be kidding, how come?
PUDDY: Yeah, that's right.
PUDDY: Well, alright, so you don't like the face painting, I just won't paint it anymore.
PUDDY: Well, I don't need to do it. It's not like a habit or anything.
PUDDY: Yeah, that's right.
PUDDY: Ah, c'mere. (They kiss) Alright, I gotta go home and get changed before the game. I'll be back, we'll make out.
PUDDY: That's the letter 'D'.
PUDDY: Well, I'm going to the game tonight, and me and these five other guys are gonna take our shirts off and spell out 'Devils'.
PUDDY: No, I said no more face painting, and as you can see this is not my face.
PUDDY: Hey, great game, huh?
PUDDY: Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a twenty kroner? No wait, that's another ten kroner. A fimty kroner? How much is that?
PUDDY: What?
PUDDY: Well what about you? What do you think The Gap in Rome has that's not in The Gap on Broadway?
PUDDY: Fine!
PUDDY: (to flight attendant) You know I think ultimately, I'm upset with myself. I knew what I was getting into, she's a bitter, unstable person. I mean the sex was good. I'm sure it was fine for her. I need more.
PUDDY: Yeah, I know.
PUDDY: It's a long flight, Elaine. I had to get on with my life.
PUDDY: Yeah, that's right. Well, what's going on over there with you and, uh, Vegetable Lasagna?
PUDDY: Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were up to me, we'd still be together.
PUDDY: Ok.
PUDDY: Let's make out.
PUDDY: It was stupid.
PUDDY: No I'm good.
PUDDY: No.
PUDDY: Yeah.
PUDDY: Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back.
PUDDY: Ditto.
PUDDY: Go to Hell.
PUDDY: Hey Benes, How are you?
PUDDY: Great. (pauses) See ya.
PUDDY: So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.
PUDDY: I mean I love just seeing you and having sex.
PUDDY: Not having to do all that…you know…work.
PUDDY: All that calling you, and buying you stuff…
PUDDY: Caring about how everyone at work isn’t as smart as you. It’s brutal.
PUDDY: Oh, no.
PUDDY: Look Elaine, be reasonable.
PUDDY: What?
PUDDY: Hey, you want to split a root beer (I think that’s what he says)?
PUDDY: Oh…That’s a nice sweater (Elaine smiles).
PUDDY: ELAINE: I want to break up.
PUDDY: (finishing eating) Seriously, is this the best okra you've ever had, or what?
PUDDY: Delish?
PUDDY: Oh, like scrump.
PUDDY: (leaving) I'm gonna be late. See ya later.
PUDDY: You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman.
PUDDY: Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and you see the Maytag repairman.
PUDDY: (leaving) That's right.
PUDDY: Hi.
PUDDY: (heading towards the bathroom) I got to make a pit stop.
PUDDY: (staring into space, picks up the phone) Puddy.
PUDDY: This is Puddy.
PUDDY: I know.
PUDDY: Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the auxiliary drainage line.
PUDDY: It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?
PUDDY: (seeing Elaine come in) Hey, man, I'll call you back. I'll talk you through it.
PUDDY: Hey, Babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for a balloon bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him.
PUDDY: Peggy took a turn for the worst.
PUDDY: That's what he said.
PUDDY: Talk to me, Babe.
PUDDY: Oh, germ-o-phobe. I know what that's about.
PUDDY: (showing her his necklace) I'm a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years.
PUDDY: It's a germ.
PUDDY: Don't you? Elaine.
PUDDY: I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex.
PUDDY: I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers she slogs around in.
PUDDY: They're bacteria traps.
PUDDY: For the most part.
PUDDY: Oh, germs. Germs. Germs!
PUDDY: (waiting with Elaine and Peggy) No, germ-o-phobes.
PUDDY: Sorry I’m late. 
PUDDY: Arby’s. 
PUDDY: All right. Classic. (Holds his hand up) High-five. 
PUDDY: Oh, sure, babe. Salesman-only copy room (Points) right there. 
PUDDY: (To Jerry and George) Hey, come on, guys. I’ll show you the 900. 
PUDDY: (Pointing out his office door) By the service department. 
PUDDY: I don’t care for that term. 
PUDDY: No, I don’t know too many monkeys who could take apart a fuel injector. 
PUDDY: Yeah, I saw that one. Uh.. Koko. 
PUDDY: Right, Koko. That chimp’s all right. (Holds up his hand) High-five. 
PUDDY: (Standing up) Well, there’s a vending machine. I could show you where it is. (Leaves, showing George the way) 
PUDDY: Good news. We got a 900 in black. That’s the hot color. (Holds up his hand) High-five. 
PUDDY: (Pointing at Jerry) You owe me five. 
PUDDY: Paper jam.. Got it! 
PUDDY: (Holds his hand up) High-five. (Elaine reluctantly slaps it. He turns around, and puts his hand out behind his back) On the flip side. 
PUDDY: (Still holding out his hand) Don’t leave me hangin’. 
PUDDY: What did I tell you about that? 
PUDDY: (Somewhat hurt) Oh yeah? I’ll tell you what’s stupid. You. Stupid. 
PUDDY: Yeah? So are you. You’re the grease monkey. 
PUDDY: Yeah, if you leave, we’re through. 
PUDDY: Oh, so you’re leaving? 
PUDDY: Let’s finish this up. 
PUDDY: (While punching up numbers on a calculator) That chick’s whacked. We’re history. (Back to the transaction) I just left out a couple of things: uh, rust-proofing… 
PUDDY: (Reading off what he’s adding up on the calculator) Transport charge, storage surcharge, additional overcharge, finder’s fee… 
PUDDY: Yeah, that’s right. (Continues reading off) Uh, floor mats, keys… 
PUDDY: How ya gonna start it? 
PUDDY: (Handing a sheet of paper to Jerry) Jerry, I just need your signature here, and we’ll get you that yellow car ready to go. 
PUDDY: I can’t give you black at that price. 
PUDDY: Okay. 
PUDDY: I’m with a customer. 
PUDDY: (Like a kid) I don’t want to get back with her. She’s too bossy. 
PUDDY: Right. 
PUDDY: Good point. 
PUDDY: There’s a mental hospital right near here. 
PUDDY: I can live with that. 
PUDDY: Yeah. 
PUDDY: Oh, we don’t even know what it is. 
PUDDY: Insider’s deal. (Holds up his hand) High-five. 
PUDDY: Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?
PUDDY: It's my winter coat.
PUDDY: Is there a problem?
PUDDY: Ow!
PUDDY: Hey.
PUDDY: Sure thing, Joe Mayo.
PUDDY: (standing guard by the stereo as George walks by him) Hey! Cocktail off the speaker.
PUDDY: All right, let's hit the bricks.
PUDDY: Hey, Babe.
PUDDY: It's my new coat.
PUDDY: Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball.
PUDDY: All signs point to 'Yes!'
PUDDY: Alright, be careful with the car, babe.
PUDDY: And don't move the seat, I got it right where I like it.
PUDDY: Two and ten, babe.
PUDDY: Don't peel out.
PUDDY: Feels like an Arby's night.
PUDDY: Yes.
PUDDY: That's right.
PUDDY: Not for me.
PUDDY: I'm not the one going to hell.
PUDDY: Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just grab that one.
PUDDY: C'mon, get it.
PUDDY: Sorry, thou shalt not steal.
PUDDY: What do you care, you know where you're going.
PUDDY: Nah.
PUDDY: Alright, what did I do?
PUDDY: Gonna be rough.
PUDDY: Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.
PUDDY: You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?
PUDDY: Yeah, that's right.
PUDDY: No.
PUDDY: No way, this is bogus, man!
PUDDY: I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell.
PUDDY: Alright.
