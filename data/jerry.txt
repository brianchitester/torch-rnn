JERRY: Do you know what this is all about? 
JERRY: (pointing at George’s shirt) See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. It’s too high! 
JERRY: You do of course try on, when you buy?
JERRY: Oh, you don’t recall?
JERRY: Well, senator, I’d just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it.
JERRY: Can you relax, it’s a cup of coffee. Claire is a professional waitress.
JERRY: Well, there’s this uh, woman might be comin’ in.
JERRY: I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?
JERRY: I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? 
JERRY: (looks in the creamer) There’s no milk in here, what...
JERRY: Oh, she’s really great. I mean, she’s got like a real warmth about her and she’s really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better.
JERRY: Oh, nothing happened, you know, but is was great.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we’ll get together. 
JERRY: Yeah, but...
JERRY: Yeah!
JERRY: What, are you serious...why, why did she call?
JERRY: To be polite? 
JERRY: Yes!
JERRY: Oh, I get it, this is about the button.
JERRY: Oh you are beautiful!
JERRY: Good. Did you have fun? 
JERRY: Oh, come on, be a come-with guy.
JERRY: Well, look at this guy. Look, he’s got everything, he’s got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners.  This is not his first load.
JERRY: And you didn’t even hear how she sounded.
JERRY: Laura.
JERRY: Yeah, but how could you be so sure?
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Maybe you’re right.
JERRY: This is insane. You know, I don’t even know where she’s staying! 
JERRY: No no no, don’t interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what it’s doing. Just let it finish.
JERRY: You, you can’t overdry.
JERRY: Same as you can’t overwet. You see, once something is wet, it’s wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die you’re dead, right? 
JERRY: How could she not tell me where she was staying? 
JERRY: Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...y’know, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, it’s dark, there’s bubbles happening, they’re all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, “C’mon babe, let’s go”. You come by, you open up the lid and they’ll- (stiffens up, as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, they’re in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, “Tomorrow, the dryer, I’m goin’. 
JERRY: (answering, quickly) If you know what happened in the Met game, don’t say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, I’m sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no 
JERRY: (to the door) Yeah?
JERRY: (to Kessler) Yeah. (to the phone) Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? 
JERRY: (upset) Ohhhh, what are you doing? 
JERRY: Meat? 
JERRY: (cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven’t been out of the building in ten years!
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.
JERRY: No, it’s okay now, that, that girl is not comin’. Uh, I misread the whole thing.
JERRY: I don’t think so.
JERRY: That close, huh?
JERRY: Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.
JERRY: (to the phone) No believe me, I’m always up at this hour. 
JERRY: No, it’s, it’s just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it. (Jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) Ten-fifteen... No, don’t be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, it’s no trouble at all... I’ll see you tomorrow... Great, bye. (He hangs up the phone; to Kessler) I don’t believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here! 
JERRY: If my father was moving this he’d had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. 
JERRY: Look, it’s a very awkward situation. I don’t wanna be presumptuous.
JERRY: All right, she said she couldn’t find a decent hotel room...
JERRY: Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.
JERRY: (cynical) This is the signal? 
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: This is a person I like, it’s not “How to score on spring break”.
JERRY: Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom.
JERRY: Now, how could that be good?
JERRY: This is how you operate?
JERRY: Let me just wipe the sink.
JERRY: The dating world is not a fun world...it’s a pressure world, it’s a world of tension, it’s a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, ‘cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don’t know what they need. I know I don’t have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one I’m- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, we’re all human beings, what is the story? 
JERRY: Wouldn’t it be great if you could ask a woman what she’s thinking?
JERRY: You know, instead, I’m like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: Uh-huh.
JERRY: Right.
JERRY: Lip area.
JERRY: Hug is definitely good.
JERRY: Although what if it’s one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?
JERRY: You know how they do that?
JERRY: Shake is bad, but what if it’s the two-hander? 
JERRY: Right.
JERRY: Hey, hey.
JERRY: Heeeey!
JERRY: It’s good to see you.
JERRY: This is my friend George.
JERRY: This is Laura.
JERRY: (to Laura) I can’t believe you’re here.
JERRY: Ooh yeah, the bags, sure. 
JERRY: (aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?
JERRY: So uh, what do you think?
JERRY: Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything? 
JERRY: Uh, yeah, I think I do.
JERRY: Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead.
JERRY: Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don’t you stay? 
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: (unenthusiastic) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) I’m just, I’m really glad you’re here.
JERRY: (answering) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Um, it’s for you.
JERRY: (not excited) You’re engaged?
JERRY: You’re engaged? 
JERRY: (matter-of-factly) You’re engaged. 
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Me too!
JERRY: I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I don’t get it, okay? 
JERRY: So, I’m on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the...
JERRY: Cheque. Now, the fact is, if it’s a woman in front of you that’s writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, y’know, ‘cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they don’t know where that is, but the cheque book: they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster: (Jerry “draws” imaginary book from a holster.) “Who do I make it out to? 
JERRY: What’s that one?
JERRY: Maybe they came back for Chinese food. 
JERRY: Oh yeah? 
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: “So, uh, what’s your son doing now, Dr. 
JERRY: Pamela? 
JERRY: Oh yeah, right...
JERRY: (quickly) No.
JERRY: (a lightbulb goes on in his head) Riverside Drive.
JERRY: Well, what is it?
JERRY: Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.
JERRY: I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.
JERRY: Y’know, my parents are coming in for this...
JERRY: Yeah, tomorrow.
JERRY: No, no. Still doin’ the big sweep across.
JERRY: Doesn’t think anyone can tell. So c’mon, do we have a deal?
JERRY: There’s a lot of people to mock...
JERRY: Great!
JERRY: Was I supposed to bring something?
JERRY: I met her one time...
JERRY: What did you say then?
JERRY: Hi, happy birthday.
JERRY: I didn’t bring anything.
JERRY: Oh, Okay (turns to rest of table) I’m sorry, I didn’t know what to bring, nobody told me.
JERRY: I’m in for five...
JERRY: (thinking) Uh-oh... What do we have here?
JERRY: Oh, I can’t. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly.
JERRY: Plus I’m wearing short sleeves, I don’t want to expose my tattoos. (Vanessa smiles; thinking) She’s unbelievable!
JERRY: (thinking) What’s going on here? 
JERRY: Uh, friend of a friend. And you?
JERRY: (turning to Elaine; thinking) Oh no, not now.
JERRY: Oh really? 
JERRY: No kidding. (thinking) Why is this happening? 
JERRY: (thinking) This is brutal.
JERRY: How do you like that? 
JERRY: Yes, I heard you.
JERRY: (thinking) Thank you, Pamela! 
JERRY: (thinking) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft... (to Vanessa) Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit.
JERRY: Imagine, spelling “Mom” with two O’s.
JERRY: Comedian.
JERRY: (thinking; quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
JERRY: (thinking) I can’t believe it. I got nothing! 
JERRY: That wasn’t so bad, really.
JERRY: Why? 
JERRY: I was listening!
JERRY: No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.
JERRY: Where you had, uh, wooden teeth.
JERRY: All right, so I had wooden teeth, so what?
JERRY: Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, “Yeah, I got this new thing: Platonic. My idea, my name, callin’ it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- don’t do anything, and go right home. What’d you think? 
JERRY: Hey!
JERRY: This is what I like, see? 
JERRY: What are you talkin’ about? 
JERRY: Ma, will you stop?
JERRY: I don’t care. I’m sleeping next door.
JERRY: No, he’s making a bouillabaisse.
JERRY: So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?
JERRY: Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?
JERRY: No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I don’t know her name.
JERRY: Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can’t ask her.
JERRY: Because it’s complicated. There’s some tension there.
JERRY: Oh yeah, she’s great.
JERRY: Well, it’s a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno...
JERRY: You don’t know what it was.
JERRY: Well, we fight a lot for some reason.
JERRY: And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.
JERRY: Oh, she is, she absolutely is.
JERRY: No, it’s not that. It wasn’t all one-sided.
JERRY: I know, I know...
JERRY: That’s got nothin’ to do with it.
JERRY: What are you two talking about? 
JERRY: I dunno, maybe...
JERRY: I can’t. She’ll get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.
JERRY: We’re friends.
JERRY: Oh yeah.
JERRY: I guess.
JERRY: You mean stakeout the lobby?
JERRY: Y’know what? 
JERRY: I dunno. Hard to say.
JERRY: Loni Anderson.
JERRY: What, there’s something wrong with Loni Anderson? 
JERRY: I’m a little nervous.
JERRY: If I see her, what do I say that I’m doing here in the building?
JERRY: What do you do?
JERRY: You’re an architect?
JERRY: I don’t see architecture comin from you.
JERRY: I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin’ else.
JERRY: Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?
JERRY: What is his name?
JERRY: Bert Harbinson? 
JERRY: Art Cor...
JERRY: Corvelay?
JERRY: Well, what does he do?
JERRY: Just imports, no exports?
JERRY: No, I guess she’s still mad.
JERRY: Never. (The elevator door opens.) Wait a second. That’s her. On the right.
JERRY: You’re you. We’re having lunch with Art Corvelay.
JERRY: Corvelay!
JERRY: Hey, hey. uh Pamela’s birthday party, didn’t I see you there? 
JERRY: Uh, this is George. (reaches for her name) I’m sorry...
JERRY: Ah, Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
JERRY: Oh, we’re meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building.
JERRY: He’s an importer/exporter.
JERRY: Y’know I’m sorry you had to leave so early the other night.
JERRY: Oh, that guy was your cousin! 
JERRY: Friend!
JERRY: So, um, do you date uh immature men?
JERRY: (annoyed) Ma, will you go already?
JERRY: You can’t look in there, we’re playing!
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Look.
JERRY: Maybe!
JERRY: Ma, you can’t look up words in the dictionary! 
JERRY: Well put something down, you’re taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac and Artie, they’re all coming over here before the wedding?
JERRY: She said what?
JERRY: She knows! 
JERRY: She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator...
JERRY: Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.
JERRY: Yes. Yes I am! 
JERRY: Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? 
JERRY: Yeah, but now I’m nervous.
JERRY: “Quone”?
JERRY: “Quone”? 
JERRY: I am challenging.
JERRY: Uh-huh.
JERRY: No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off.
JERRY: You must have quite a time down there.
JERRY: Oh, I’m sorry. I’m just waiting for someone.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah...
JERRY: Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it.
JERRY: That’s perfect.
JERRY: Could you excuse me one second? 
JERRY: How do you do? 
JERRY: Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?
JERRY: All right, the whole elevator business, let me just explain-
JERRY: No, I’m gonna take my car.
JERRY: Anyway, you know why I didn’t ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab.
JERRY: Oh, I’m sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.
JERRY: (sarcastically) Yeah, “Levine”. And I’m Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.
JERRY: I mean, if we’re gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.
JERRY: Good.
JERRY: Good.
JERRY: Great? 
JERRY: ...Guys?
JERRY: Uh-huh. Yeah. So, anybody specific?
JERRY: Oh really? 
JERRY: No, that’s great! 
JERRY: Doesn’t matter. What’s the young man’s name? 
JERRY: Well, what does he do? 
JERRY: Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut.
JERRY: (pause) All right, sir.
JERRY: Now that’s not fair! 
JERRY: Uh huh. When you’re on a stakeout, do you find it’s better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?
JERRY: Y’know I think that even if you’ve had a relationship with someone, or let’s say, especially if you’ve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, it’s very difficult. Isn’t this? 
JERRY: So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. It’s a finger, what does it mean? 
JERRY: Is that it? 
JERRY: (proudly) I am...the master packer.
JERRY: What you must understand, Elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) You’ve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.
JERRY: Yes.
JERRY: All right, sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) George?
JERRY: Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.
JERRY: There’s more. The refrigerator.
JERRY: Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this: No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear?
JERRY: One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity: Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub.
JERRY: Yeah, one sec.
JERRY: I’m not looking.
JERRY: Yeah, what’s it like?
JERRY: How much?
JERRY: Two bedrooms? 
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: Ohhhh...
JERRY: Like this? 
JERRY: I can’t think about it now. Come on, I’m going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.
JERRY: Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room, searching for the TV.) ELAINE!
JERRY: Great, I had fun. Where’s the TV, where’s the VCR?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Stolen? 
JERRY: Stolen?
JERRY: Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?
JERRY: The door? 
JERRY: Yeah, and?
JERRY: So the door was wide open?
JERRY: (to Elaine) And where were you?
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. It’s the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... 
JERRY: Yeah, don’t investigate, don’t pay me back, it was an accident.
JERRY: In your way.
JERRY: (disappointed) Answering machine. (jovially) Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.
JERRY: It’s a joke.
JERRY: You ever find anything?
JERRY: Well, thanks anyway.
JERRY: The crook has the machine. The messages aren’t for him. He’s the crook. Why would he answer- (Jerry gives up on the explanation and turns around to see George standing behind him.) How did you get in here?
JERRY: Again?
JERRY: (to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?
JERRY: (to George) Is that uh, other apartment still available?
JERRY: I got ripped off for about the...18th time? 
JERRY: How do you get all that wood in here?
JERRY: They deliver wood?
JERRY: What do you tip a wood guy?
JERRY: Would I have to get a gardener?
JERRY: You tip him?
JERRY: They deliver the coal?
JERRY: Oh, then I gotta tip him.
JERRY: I don’t have any plants.
JERRY: I like that. (He opens the closet. Elaine walks out with an angry look.) What do you think, George?
JERRY: I’m takin’ it, I’m takin’ the place. I’m gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. I’m livin’ here...I’m movin’.
JERRY: You like the couch? 
JERRY: You’re movin’ in, you’re a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars. (Elaine is shocked, Jerry opens the door to the hall.) Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I don’t even wanna see it, go, get it out.
JERRY: Yeah!
JERRY: Okay, you tell me. What is it worth?
JERRY: Yeah?
JERRY: Come on up. (Jerry presses the second button and opens the apartment door. He walks back to the couch.) Oh, all right, forget it, I’m gonna take it with me now... (He picks up the cushions.) I’m just gonna pack up the cushions right now...
JERRY: (continuing unphased) You wanna get the other end, ‘cause I wanna get it in the hall.
JERRY: Fifty dollars?
JERRY: Thank you very much.
JERRY: (to George) So did you bring the lease? 
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: You could take it? 
JERRY: So you do want it.
JERRY: You just said you wanted it!
JERRY: So take it.
JERRY: How can I take it?
JERRY: How can I want it now, if you want it?
JERRY: I...am not taking it.
JERRY: Well, whaddaya wanna do here?
JERRY: Do you wanna flip a coin?
JERRY: Okay, fine. (Jerry takes a coin from his pocket.) This is the official flip. No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and that’s it. Agreed?
JERRY: All right, now you call it in the air.
JERRY: No no.
JERRY: Tails!
JERRY: So what?
JERRY: You didn’t call no interference!
JERRY: I don’t believe this.
JERRY: I don’t wanna win it like this! 
JERRY: Well, I’ll tell you what. I’ll choose you for it. Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...that’s it, you gotta win three.
JERRY: Odds.
JERRY: Good.
JERRY: You got evens.
JERRY: For the apartment.
JERRY: Mine!
JERRY: Mine!
JERRY: Thanks.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Hard to imagine.
JERRY: Right.
JERRY: Ooh, (to Elaine) case closed!
JERRY: Okay, starting...NOW!
JERRY: One of the problems in life is that when you’re a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. 
JERRY: It’s a good mirror. (They look at their menus.) So, what are you gettin’?
JERRY: All right, forget it, forget it. I’m not taking the place!
JERRY: How can I live there?
JERRY: Look at you, you’re still thinking about it. I’ll never feel comfortable.
JERRY: How can I ever have you over? 
JERRY: You’re already moping! 
JERRY: You found the place.
JERRY: All right, forget it, it’s over, I’m not moving.
JERRY: Definitely?
JERRY: Alright, then just get rid of it. You won’t have any problem.
JERRY: She wanted to thank us for the apartment.
JERRY: If only the coin hadn’t hit the table.
JERRY: It is not!
JERRY: It’s wonderful.
JERRY: How late are the stores open? 
JERRY: Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guy’s out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, it’s true, men hear a drill, it’s like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, “Honey, I think Jim’s working on something over there.” So they run over to the guy. Now they don’t actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. That’s what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. 
JERRY: I don’t think you did anything wrong.
JERRY: We can only thank God for that.
JERRY: You’re imagining this. Really.
JERRY: What floss? 
JERRY: Ah, mint.
JERRY: So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.
JERRY: And you’re sure the floss was the catalyst?
JERRY: You don’t think it might’ve had anything to do with that?
JERRY: It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.
JERRY: (to Kramer) Who is it?
JERRY: Who is it?
JERRY: (to the phone) Hello? 
JERRY: Maybe I didn’t want to talk to him.
JERRY: He bothers me. I don’t even answer the phone anymore because of him. He’s turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.
JERRY: We’re going. That’s next Wednesday.
JERRY: His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? 
JERRY: Can you conduct your business elsewhere?
JERRY: I don’t bother with him. He’s been calling me for seven years. I’ve never called him once! 
JERRY: What can I do? 
JERRY: Just break up with him?
JERRY: The Truth.
JERRY: As a guy I don’t know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? 
JERRY: You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-
JERRY: (testing Joel) So, I’m thinking about going to Iran this summer.
JERRY: Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. (Joel shakes his head agreeing; Jerry smiles) You know, it’s their annual terrorist luncheon.
JERRY: (cont'd) I’m gonna do it in Farsi.
JERRY: Yeah, I’ll have the egg salad on whole wheat.
JERRY: How can you talk to someone like that?
JERRY: Listen, Joel. There’s something I have to tell you...
JERRY: Listen, Joel, I don’t think we should see each other anymore.
JERRY: This friendship: It’s not working.
JERRY: We’re just not suited to be friends.
JERRY: Look, you’re a nice guy, it’s just that... we don’t have anything in common.
JERRY: Y-You didn’t do anything. It’s not you, it’s me. It’s- this is very difficult.
JERRY: No, it’s not that.
JERRY: Oh, come on. That’s not true.
JERRY: I know, I know.
JERRY: Best friend- I’ve never been to your apartment.
JERRY: Okay, okay. Forget it. It’s okay. I didn’t mean it.
JERRY: What I said. I’ve been under a lot of stress.
JERRY: Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? 
JERRY: No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I would’ve said tonight.
JERRY: (lying) Yes.
JERRY: Next Wednesday.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Ugh, the four worst words in the English language.
JERRY: That is worse.
JERRY: Really.
JERRY: Hm. You ate.
JERRY: Someone says, “Get out of my life,” and that doesn’t affect your appetite?
JERRY: It is unbelievable.
JERRY: How much could you possibly have in there?
JERRY: Yeah? 
JERRY: C’mon, move up.
JERRY: Oh, God.
JERRY: Listen, George, little problem with the game.
JERRY: The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..
JERRY: I gave your ticket to Horneck.
JERRY: Yeah, I’m sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.
JERRY: C’mon, c’mon, go ahead, move up.
JERRY: You didn’t see him. It was horrible.
JERRY: I had to do it.
JERRY: Do you want to go with him? 
JERRY: No, I do not like the bank. I’ve heard the expression “Laughing all the way to the bank.” I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when there’s nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, it’s empty and you still have to go through the little maze. (walking on the stage like he is going through a maze) “Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? 
JERRY: George.
JERRY: Could you stop the counting?
JERRY: Can I make it up to you? 
JERRY: Well, then I’m not going to the game either. Okay? 
JERRY: I- no, I don’t want to go.
JERRY: I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and I’ll just make up some excuse why I can’t go to the game either.
JERRY: George, the man wept.
JERRY: I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I can’t imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but that’s me. Alright
JERRY: I’m just saying..Alright.
JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: (to the phone) Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you- Oh, Hi. Joel... Oh, you just came in... Listen, I can’t make it to the game tonight... I, uh, have to tutor my nephew... Yeah, he’s got an exam tomorrow... Geometry... You know, trapezoids, rhombus... Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. They’re at the Will-Call window... And I’m really sorry... Have a good time... We’ll talk next week... Okay... Yeah, I don’t... Fine.. Fine... Bye.
JERRY: I know. I’m really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.
JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: Where do you want to go?
JERRY: We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.
JERRY: We could talk.
JERRY: Then we’ll just sit there.
JERRY: Okay, just hand that over, please.
JERRY: It’s a list of excuses, it’s for that guy, Horneck, who’s at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I don’t have to see him. (Elaine laughs.) I need it. (Elaine starts writing on the list.) What are you doing?
JERRY: I don’t need any more.
JERRY: (not amused) Very funny.
JERRY: I’m Dan. Can I have my list back, please?
JERRY: What can I do?
JERRY: Oh no. That’s impossible. I’d rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.
JERRY: Couple of tough monkeys.
JERRY: Game?
JERRY: Wait. How does Horneck know you?
JERRY: This is too much.
JERRY: Oh, no.
JERRY: Perfect.
JERRY: Oh, we finished early.
JERRY: Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.
JERRY: We’re still friends.
JERRY: Right. I forgot about choir.
JERRY: Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything.
JERRY: You really should.
JERRY: You know, I really... I’ve come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that they’re just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you don’t really wanna see them. You don’t call them, they call you. You don’t call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you don’t really have anything in common with is to pretend you’re hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend there’s a little desk around you. The only problem with this is there’s no way you can say, “Hey, it’s been great having you on the show. We’re out of time.”
JERRY: Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because money’s a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you don’t care about money when you’re hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, you’re like the ruler of an empire. “More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! 
JERRY: I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.
JERRY: But it’s common sense. He’s got super strength, super speed. I’m sure he’s got super humor.
JERRY: Why? 
JERRY: No problem.
JERRY: Were you crying? 
JERRY: Robert.
JERRY: I’ve been thinking about asking this girl I’m, uh, seeing-
JERRY: Vanessa, thank you. I’ve been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.
JERRY: You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.
JERRY: What stock?
JERRY: Maybe.
JERRY: How high’s it suppose to go?
JERRY: Boy... I don’t know.
JERRY: What kind of company is it?
JERRY: Well, how much are you going to invest?
JERRY: Boy...
JERRY: What if I lose it?
JERRY: All right. Twenty-five hundred.
JERRY: My bet? 
JERRY: Oh, the dolphin thing?
JERRY: Ohhh... You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.
JERRY: Hey, when I’m driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. I’m always waving everybody in. “Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.” ...All right. All right. I’ll have a chicken salad.
JERRY: I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.
JERRY: What do you want me to do? 
JERRY: You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.
JERRY: It’s great! 
JERRY: Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.
JERRY: Yeah. We can fish. What? 
JERRY: Oh, big fighting marlin. (Jerry acts like he is catching a marlin)
JERRY: Is that my paper?
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Oh, c’mon! 
JERRY: Oh, I can’t believe it. Let me see that. (Jerry takes the paper.) That’s four and a half points in three days! 
JERRY: (sarcastic) Yeah, you told me.
JERRY: There’s one thing I don’t understand. Why does it please you? 
JERRY: Roll-out tie dispenser? 
JERRY: Okay...
JERRY: (going along with it) Oh No!
JERRY: You’re gone all right.
JERRY: Yeah, I’m going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days.
JERRY: What friends?
JERRY: So you don’t know what’s wrong with him?
JERRY: Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?
JERRY: Well, this is it. I’m selling.
JERRY: I never should’ve gotten involved in this. I’m a nervous wreck. I’m not cut out for investing.
JERRY: Where?
JERRY: The hospital?
JERRY: Are you nuts? 
JERRY: What if he’s in an iron lung or something? 
JERRY: Who goes to the hospital to rest?
JERRY: Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. It’s completely shrunk. There’s absolutely no way I can wear it.
JERRY: What’s the difference? 
JERRY: I can’t find the receipt.
JERRY: Look, forget about the receipt, all right? 
JERRY: What do you think this is a little scam I have? 
JERRY: No! 
JERRY: You shrunk it! 
JERRY: I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, “Well, it’s ruined.” And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, “It’s not our fault. We’re not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation.” You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? 
JERRY: Bless you.
JERRY: Well, it couldn’t be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?
JERRY: I’m no cat killer.
JERRY: I’d really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, he’s nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper up to Jerry.) I know, I know. It’s down again.
JERRY: I don’t know.. fifteen hundred dollars.
JERRY: You don’t have to say “Wow.” I know it’s “Wow.” (Kramer smiling) And there’s that smile again. Well, what is that? 
JERRY: I really don’t need to look.
JERRY: Yeah, and you’re just what she’s looking for too – a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: You told him you knew Simons?
JERRY: Well, that’s it. Look, I’m going to Vermont. I don’t want to think about this. I’m selling.
JERRY: So I know this guy. I’m getting all my sneakers at a discount now.
JERRY: Oh yeah, right.
JERRY: (thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? 
JERRY: Well, that’s good.
JERRY: (thinking) Well, the drive home should be a delight. I’m speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I don’t care. (to Vanessa) That's the manager? 
JERRY: So, I guess you don’t find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?
JERRY: Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?
JERRY: No, what? 
JERRY: (thinking) Yeah, that’s normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?
JERRY: I did. I’m just curious. It’s been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points? 
JERRY: You did not tell me not to sell.
JERRY: Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!
JERRY: What?
JERRY: No, what? 
JERRY: (thinking) So, what am I looking at here? 
JERRY: (acidly) She’s full. So, Big Daddy. I’m just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?
JERRY: How much?
JERRY: So, Wilkinson’s out of the hospital now?
JERRY: Is that still from the cats?
JERRY: So, what ever happened with that?
JERRY: I gotta say, that’s pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.
JERRY: We went over that.
JERRY: A robot butcher?
JERRY: I’m not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. I’ve decided I’ll do the work. I’m gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? 
JERRY: I’m always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? 
JERRY: No, of course not.
JERRY: Everyday.
JERRY: You tried.
JERRY: Did you tell her you loved her?
JERRY: You’re a human being.
JERRY: You’re too nice a guy.
JERRY: You’re flesh and blood.
JERRY: I told you when I met her.
JERRY: You gotta go to my chiropractor, he’s the best.
JERRY: I’m gonna make an appointment for you. We’ll go together.
JERRY: You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! 
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Hello.
JERRY: No, shower. So, where are we eating?
JERRY: A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in “The Blob”.
JERRY: Hello... Hello. 
JERRY: (to the phone) Oh, it’s you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldn’t have had to do this. Now that’s two long distance calls I made to you why can’t you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again; to nobody) Why? 
JERRY: No, I just had a sandwich.
JERRY: I don’t want cantaloupe now.
JERRY: I only eat cantaloupe at certain times...
JERRY: ...all right!
JERRY: It’s very good.
JERRY: Good.
JERRY: Uh-huh.
JERRY: It’s too far.
JERRY: I’m not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? 
JERRY: I don’t return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.
JERRY: You did it? 
JERRY: Uh-huh...
JERRY: See, it’s never as bad as you imagine.
JERRY: (to Kramer) Could you stop that smacking?
JERRY: It’s very good cantaloupe. (Kramer leaves; to George) So that’s it? 
JERRY: So, go get them.
JERRY: So forget about the books. Did you read them?
JERRY: What do you need them for?
JERRY: What is this obsession people have with books? 
JERRY: So you want me to get the books? 
JERRY: So what’d you do?
JERRY: Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: I don’t know how this happened.
JERRY: No, no. It’s not your fault. “Books, books, I need my books.” Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? 
JERRY: (disgusted) Ohh! 
JERRY: (more disgusted) Ohhhh! 
JERRY: Yeah. Yes, she is.
JERRY: The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. ‘Cause it says “Waiting Room.” There’s no chance of not waiting. ‘Cause they call it the waiting room, they’re gonna use it. They’ve got it. It’s all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and you’ve got your little magazine. You pretend you’re reading it, but you’re really looking at the other people. You know, you’re thinking about about them. Things like, “I wonder what he’s got. As soon as she goes, I’m getting her magazine.” And then, they finally call you and it’s a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. “Well, I guess I’ve been chosen. I’ll see you all later.” You know, so you think you’re going to see the doctor, but you’re not, are you? 
JERRY: So, how was it?
JERRY: Well, it’s a first visit.
JERRY: You can’t do that.
JERRY: He’s a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.
JERRY: No, I’m fine.
JERRY: Yeah, I know.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: (belated) Good night.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Uh-huh.
JERRY: That is out there.
JERRY: No, supermarket.
JERRY: It’s uh okay.
JERRY: I’m not taking it back.
JERRY: I don’t care about it.
JERRY: All right. Take it back.
JERRY: Marlene.
JERRY: Yeah, I took her home one night – we kinda started up a little bit in the car.
JERRY: I was. But, she’s got me, like, hypnotized.
JERRY: No, he’d go nuts.
JERRY: I feel terrible. (Kramer smiling) I mean, I’ve seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I can’t go any further, but... She’s just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I can’t breathe. It’s like a drug.
JERRY: I don’t know how I’m going to tell him.
JERRY: It’s partially you, yeah.
JERRY: Well, he can’t kill me, right?
JERRY: I mean, she called me. I haven’t called her. She started it.
JERRY: I’m a nice guy.
JERRY: (excited) Oh, my little airplane lamp.
JERRY: Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don’t have to be home on time.
JERRY: Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people.
JERRY: Well, you know what they say. Lucky in love, Unlucky with fruit.
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: You talked to him?
JERRY: Right.
JERRY: You said "you little phony"?
JERRY: This is amazing.
JERRY: You are the Queen of Confrontation. You’re my new hero. In fact, you’ve inspired me. I’m gonna call George about something right now.
JERRY: You’re kidding.
JERRY: You mean that?
JERRY: You don’t care?
JERRY: How could you not care?
JERRY: I thought you’d be upset.
JERRY: Am I a bad person? 
JERRY: That voice. That voice. She’s driving me crazy.
JERRY: So I can see her tonight, and you don’t care?
JERRY: All right. As long as you’re okay. Because I can’t stop thinking about her.
JERRY: Good. And I’ll tell you what... You don’t have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.
JERRY: I had to.
JERRY: It was embarrassing to me.
JERRY: Why don’t you make a point with your own doctor? 
JERRY: So, you wanna come up for a few minutes?
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: Gee, I just didn’t expect it from the way you’ve been acting.
JERRY: Of course I want to talk about it.
JERRY: Tuesday night? 
JERRY: My act? 
JERRY: I can’t believe this. So what are you saying? 
JERRY: You’re a cashier!
JERRY: You can’t go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.
JERRY: I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend.
JERRY: Women need to like the job of the guy they’re with. If they don’t like the job, they don’t like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. “Well, right now, I’m the regional management supervisor. I’m in development, research, consulting...” Men on the other hand – if they are physically attracted to a woman – are not that concerned with her job. Are we? 
JERRY: My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didn’t want to move to Florida, but they’re in their sixties, and that’s the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old people’s house with a golf cart, jump out, “Let’s go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. 
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: (to Morty) Would you make this thing lower! 
JERRY: We won. I made an incredible play in the field! 
JERRY: Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.
JERRY: Well, the man’s an individualist – he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what he’s doing.
JERRY: First of all, I made plans with Elaine.
JERRY: I don’t even know them. What is she, your second cousin? 
JERRY: If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He’s always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it’s because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.
JERRY: Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.
JERRY: We won. We’re in the finals on Wednesday.
JERRY: (to Kramer and Morty) What is this about?
JERRY: What are you doing?
JERRY: Levels?
JERRY: You drew up plans for this?
JERRY: When do you intend to do this?
JERRY: You’re doing this yourself?
JERRY: Oh, no. It’s not that I don’t think you can. I know that you can’t, and I’m positive that you won’t.
JERRY: I, don’t see it happening.
JERRY: Seriously?
JERRY: I’ll give you a year.
JERRY: It’s a bet.
JERRY: (to Elaine) Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?
JERRY: Yeah, Uncle Leo.
JERRY: Right. For the reducing of the pond scum?
JERRY: Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour.
JERRY: Mickey Mantle?
JERRY: (eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.
JERRY: Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.
JERRY: Yeah, I can’t eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I can’t dance.
JERRY: Horses? 
JERRY: I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.
JERRY: Well, I didn’t uh really mean a pony, per se...
JERRY: Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing...
JERRY: Well, I’m sure you did. Who wouldn’t love a pony? 
JERRY: No, see, we didn’t have ponies. I’m sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..
JERRY: I didn’t know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? 
JERRY: I’ll drive you to the airport.
JERRY: I just hope that whole pony incident didn’t put a damper on the trip.
JERRY: Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I’m sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.
JERRY: Maybe I will.
JERRY: (laughing) Really? 
JERRY: Take care.
JERRY: Bye, Dad. Take it easy.
JERRY: So, when do I get my dinner?
JERRY: Yes, I know you’re not gonna do it. That’s why I bet.
JERRY: That’s the bet! 
JERRY: We didn’t bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.
JERRY: Well, of course it could be done! 
JERRY: That’s the bet! 
JERRY: Uncle Leo.
JERRY: I don’t know. He said he’d call back.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: You don’t think... What? 
JERRY: You don’t think that I killed her?
JERRY: It was just an innocent comment! 
JERRY: The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke. (The phone rings.) That’s probably Uncle Leo.
JERRY: Wednesday? 
JERRY: Ah
JERRY: I’ve got the softball game on Wednesday. It’s the championship.
JERRY: I didn’t even know the woman.
JERRY: I mean I met her three times. I don’t even know her last name.
JERRY: I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? 
JERRY: I don’t know what to do.
JERRY: We don’t understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you can’t stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I don’t see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? 
JERRY: Two Forty-Five.
JERRY: Two o’ clock.
JERRY: Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.
JERRY: You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldn’t expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.
JERRY: I know, and then you say to yourself, “From this moment on, I’m not gonna waste any more of it.” But then you go, “How? 
JERRY: Me? 
JERRY: Bender.
JERRY: Fifty years they were married. Now he’s moving to Pheonix.
JERRY: I don’t know. They’ve been in there since, like, World War II. The rent’s three hundred a month.
JERRY: Well, the game’s starting just about now.
JERRY: I just wanted to say how sorry I was...
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.
JERRY: You know Jeffery?
JERRY: It’s raining? 
JERRY: It’s never happened to me before.
JERRY: I’ll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
JERRY: I thought there were two outs.
JERRY: Oh, well, of course. Nineteen-seventy-three.
JERRY: Wonder about what?
JERRY: You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?
JERRY: But I went to the funeral.
JERRY: Don’t you think she woulda heard I was there?
JERRY: Who figures and immigrant’s gonna have a pony?
JERRY: What is the pony? 
JERRY: I hate clothes, okay? 
JERRY: Why don’t they open up an entire store for the back? 
JERRY: (pointing to Elaine) Her father wrote that.
JERRY: I guess I’m coming. I mean...
JERRY: No, I’ll go. I’m going.
JERRY: I’m worried I won’t be able to talk to him. He’s such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.
JERRY: What is this?
JERRY: This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.
JERRY: This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.
JERRY: How much is it?
JERRY: Bad? 
JERRY: I have some idea.
JERRY: I’ve got a ballpark.
JERRY: Let me see that. (Jerry looks at the tag.) That is high.
JERRY: What’s with the pink lining and the candy stripes?
JERRY: Should I get it? 
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: What do you think?
JERRY: Is it me?
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: I don’t know. It’s got a pink lining.
JERRY: What’s the difference?
JERRY: I’d rather not say it out loud. It’s embarrassing.
JERRY: Yes, but let’s just stop it right there.
JERRY: Would you?
JERRY: I know, I know.
JERRY: I don’t know.
JERRY: Maybe.
JERRY: Do you want it?
JERRY: Okay, take it.
JERRY: What is that song?
JERRY: You know, Schumann went mad from that.
JERRY: No, you idiot.
JERRY: You don’t know Robert Schumann? 
JERRY: He went crazy from one note. He couldn’t get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.
JERRY: I know exactly what’s gonna happen tonight. I’m gonna try and act like I’m not impressed, he’s gonna see right through it.
JERRY: Let me just get my jacket.
JERRY: Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, it’s with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I might’ve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.
JERRY: Absolutely.
JERRY: I know.
JERRY: Well, what kind of solid?
JERRY: Birds?
JERRY: So take a cab.
JERRY: I can’t. I’m on my way out. There’s no way I can do it.
JERRY: (scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.
JERRY: Schumann. (George stops himself, frightened. Jerry looks around the lobby.) Where are they?
JERRY: What, you don’t want to do this?
JERRY: Yeah, I think it is. (They walk toward the man. Jerry hesitates.) Where’s Elaine?
JERRY: (to the man) Excuse me. Mister Benes?
JERRY: I’m Jerry, Elaine’s friend, and this is George.
JERRY: Sure.
JERRY: (to waiter) I’ll have a cranberry juice with two limes.
JERRY: Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. She’s usually pretty punctual. Don’t you find that, George?
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Sometimes she’s on time, and... sometimes she’s late.
JERRY: It appears that way.
JERRY: Yup.
JERRY: I’m just a regular person.
JERRY: Would you excuse me a minute? 
JERRY: That was brutal. I can’t go back out there.
JERRY: Elaine’ll kill me.
JERRY: She’s gotta be here soon.
JERRY: The waiter was trembling!
JERRY: How are we gonna get out of it?
JERRY: Yeah, that’s good. He’d clunk our heads together like Moe.
JERRY: All fathers are intimidating. They’re intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, “To hell with the world, I can make my own people. I’ll eat whatever I want, I’ll wear whatever I want, and I’ll create whoever I want.”
JERRY: Well, Guatamala...
JERRY: What about Elaine?
JERRY: She’ll be furious.
JERRY: That’s her! 
JERRY: Oh, you didn’t...
JERRY: Great.
JERRY: Oh, no, no.
JERRY: I can’t believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.
JERRY: Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the siren’s song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?
JERRY: (to George) Snow. Snow, that can’t be good for suede, can it?
JERRY: What should I do? 
JERRY: Inside out! 
JERRY: Oh, I turned my jacket inside out.
JERRY: Well, it’s a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.
JERRY: (to the intercom) Elaine?
JERRY: Come on up.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: So?
JERRY: I can’t believe I do.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: I was out in the snow last night.
JERRY: I have an idea. (Elaine enters; to Elaine) We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three.
JERRY: Is he still in town?
JERRY: I don’t know.
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: Well, I can’t wear it.
JERRY: Yeah, go ahead, take it.
JERRY: Oh, because of all the singing?
JERRY: I’ll try and remember that.
JERRY: Yeah, too bad.
JERRY: I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? 
JERRY: The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what you’re doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? 
JERRY: So you didn’t ask?
JERRY: Counter.
JERRY: He said wuss?
JERRY: So you called.
JERRY: Yeah. Like a farm boy.
JERRY: Wow. The enthusiastic hi. That’s beautiful.
JERRY: All right, so you’re chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead.
JERRY: And?
JERRY: Great day in the morning.
JERRY: Sure, it’s like robbing a bank. You don’t loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.
JERRY: (in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.
JERRY: Irish, Scottish, what’s the difference, lassie?
JERRY: You’re welcome.
JERRY: Oh, that’s okay.
JERRY: Okay... but there’s no cake or anything, if that’s what you’re looking for.
JERRY: I think if one’s going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. It’s common courtesy. I don’t know. That’s just the way I was brought up.
JERRY: Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? 
JERRY: Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? 
JERRY: Oh, I can’t begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.
JERRY: You like that commercial?
JERRY: Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?
JERRY: What could you possibly like about that?
JERRY: Yeah, they’re so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.
JERRY: Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry won't let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? 
JERRY: But they’re talking about nothing.
JERRY: I know the point.
JERRY: I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?
JERRY: What’s brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guy’ll be like, “I don’t think her eyebrows are even. 
JERRY: I’m supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?
JERRY: No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?
JERRY: You’re still thinking about this?
JERRY: She thinks you’re a guy that doesn’t like coffee.
JERRY: I like to use my own material.
JERRY: Why do we have to leave?
JERRY: You’re kicking me out of my house?
JERRY: Don’t do the apples. It’s enough already with the apples.
JERRY: I’m just gonna get my jacket, I’ll meet you downstairs. What’s the matter, did you call?
JERRY: What did you say?
JERRY: After one date you try and improvise on her machine?
JERRY: She’ll call you back. You’re overreacting.
JERRY: Not once.
JERRY: I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.
JERRY: Thank you.
JERRY: Yes, I’m lactose intolerant.
JERRY: I have no patience for lactose. And I won’t stand for it. Um, I’ll be right back.
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Well, so what if I said that?
JERRY: No, I had to tell my friends – my friends didn’t have to tell you.
JERRY: I said I couldn’t believe you liked that commercial. So what?
JERRY: Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.
JERRY: Oh uh, Kramer, this is Donna.
JERRY: Donna, really, you’re making too much of this.
JERRY: Please, Donna...
JERRY: Don’t worry about it, it wasn’t working anyway.
JERRY: I’ll tell you later.
JERRY: You said that?
JERRY: I can’t blame you. I can’t believe she never called you back.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: So she didn’t get the messages.
JERRY: But what about the messages?
JERRY: Elaine’s thing? 
JERRY: But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she’s going right for that machine.
JERRY: There’s nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: How you gonna get me up there?
JERRY: And who makes the switch?
JERRY: I do.
JERRY: I can’t get involved in this.
JERRY: What if she sees me?
JERRY: A wuss?
JERRY: Did you call me a wuss?
JERRY: I got one problem. You’re keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? 
JERRY: Tippy Toe? 
JERRY: No tippy toe.
JERRY: What song?
JERRY: What is that?
JERRY: Anything else?
JERRY: “Lemon Tree.”
JERRY: No, Trini Lopez.
JERRY: Standard. Micro.
JERRY: Feel good.
JERRY: Not at all.
JERRY: All the time.
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: You know, I really need to use the bathroom.
JERRY: Uh, you know, why don’t you go first, you just had a long trip.
JERRY: Um, you know, it’s the damnedest thing. It went away.
JERRY: Right. I am.
JERRY: (calls) Hey you two. I’m ready to go.
JERRY: Yes.
JERRY: I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didn’t want to talk to, I could go, “Excuse me, I’m not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away.” I also have a cordless phone, but I don’t like that as much, because you can’t slam down a cordless phone. 
JERRY: Well, I painted my apartment again. I’ve been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, it’s a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize it’s just the thickness of the paint, but I’m aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, it’s closer and closer. I don’t even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. That’s where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? 
JERRY: What did you do?
JERRY: Well, looks are so subjective.
JERRY: Maybe.
JERRY: (to Elaine) Harold and Manny.
JERRY: Boys, boys.
JERRY: I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?
JERRY: She died? 
JERRY: Are you kidding? 
JERRY: It’s not promised to anybody? 
JERRY: So, it’s okay? 
JERRY: (coyly) Oh, nothing important.
JERRY: What look? 
JERRY: I don’t know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I can’t decide.
JERRY: Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am – rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give...
JERRY: What would you say if I told you that...
JERRY: ...I got you an apartment in this building.
JERRY: Yes.
JERRY: Yes.
JERRY: I did.
JERRY: I got you an apartment in the building.
JERRY: Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? 
JERRY: She died.
JERRY: She died.
JERRY: And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month!
JERRY: Four hundred a month.
JERRY: Right upstairs.
JERRY: Right above me.
JERRY: All the time.
JERRY: All the time.
JERRY: The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like you’re always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? 
JERRY: You can’t believe what I just did.
JERRY: I could tell you what I did, but you wouldn’t believe it. It’s not believable.
JERRY: How could I have done that?
JERRY: I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. She’s going to move in.
JERRY: Yes. Right above me.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: I know. Neighbors.
JERRY: Right above me.
JERRY: ‘Cause I’m an idiot! 
JERRY: Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?
JERRY: She’s right in my building! 
JERRY: But I need the home bed advantage.
JERRY: Come in for two minutes and sit with me.
JERRY: Oh, who’s gonna know?
JERRY: Two minutes.
JERRY: My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? 
JERRY: So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?
JERRY: You know, the water pressure’s terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower.
JERRY: If they were fanatic about showers, they might.
JERRY: Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isn’t that child abuse?
JERRY: Yeah, the guy with the flat head.
JERRY: Yeah, I’ve heard that about wedding bands.
JERRY: That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his father’s band. He’d loan it to you.
JERRY: Boys, boys.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Hey, hey. I understand. You’re businessmen.
JERRY: Well, that’s a lot of money. But, if that’s the way it’s gotta be, that’s the way it’s gotta be.
JERRY: You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.
JERRY: Religion, my friend, that’s what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that it’s going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.
JERRY: Of course she doesn’t have five thousand dollars!
JERRY: Can’t get it.
JERRY: No move. So, you see, it’s all part of a divine plan.
JERRY: (to the intercom) Elaine?
JERRY: (to George) All right, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend I’m disappointed. You’re going to really see me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this. Maybe you should go in the other room.
JERRY: ‘Cause you know, I love Elaine.
JERRY: But you know... not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? 
JERRY: Well... there’s a little bit of a problem.
JERRY: Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. I’m sure they’d just as soon give it to you, but you’d have to come up with that money.
JERRY: I know.
JERRY: I have no idea.
JERRY: Yeah, well, I didn’t- Is that something you want to borrow?
JERRY: She doesn’t wanna borrow the money.
JERRY: Who said there’s a problem?
JERRY: (to Kramer) It was all over! 
JERRY: No, I didn’t!
JERRY: People don’t turn down money. It’s what separates us from the animals.
JERRY: Let me explain something to you. You see, you’re not normal. You’re a great guy, I love you, but you’re a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldn’t understand.
JERRY: Hi
JERRY: Yes, it’s my life’s work.
JERRY: Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.
JERRY: Oh, yes. Particularly if you’re not in it.
JERRY: What’s to see? 
JERRY: Hi how are ya?
JERRY: (no amused) Fantastic.
JERRY: I know.
JERRY: It’s tremendous.
JERRY: I’m in heaven.
JERRY: Oh, I wouldn’t quite say that.
JERRY: I’m a guy – it always looks like that.
JERRY: Nah...
JERRY: You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didn’t take it. (pointing to himself) This is an idiot.
JERRY: George, I didn’t sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. I’m just going to be honest. That’s all... Yes, I’m nervous... 
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: What are you talking about?
JERRY: Who would pay that much?
JERRY: Elaine would never borrow that much money! 
JERRY: It’s just unbelievable.
JERRY: All the time. I’ve been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I can’t live like this. I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I’m heading for breakdown! 
JERRY: Manny...
JERRY: I don’t know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three o’clock in the morning? 
JERRY: I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I don’t know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because it’s really not a definite thing yet. (crowd cheers him on to tell them) Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that I’ve received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. (audience applauds) Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn’t even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, that’s what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, “You may have already won.” I’d like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. 
JERRY: (to Kramer) To the right.
JERRY: Don’t get up.
JERRY: Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didn’t want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And it’s been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. (to Kramer) All right, so, just take what you want and let’s get it out of here.
JERRY: Grandpa clothes, I can’t wear ‘em.
JERRY: No, go ahead. Look at this place. I can’t wait to get it cleaned.
JERRY: No, Elaine’s got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and he’s suppose to do it.
JERRY: How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why don’t you just settle it like mature adults?
JERRY: Inka-dink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink.
JERRY: Not because you’re dirty, not because you’re clean – just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine...
JERRY: And you are it!
JERRY: No, he’s It. He wins. It is good.
JERRY: No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.
JERRY: All right, c’mon. Let’s go.
JERRY: Come on, let’s go.
JERRY: Aren’t you gonna take it?
JERRY: All right, let’s go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.
JERRY: The Inka-dink.. You were It.
JERRY: It’s very bad.
JERRY: (to Rava) So, where’s this boyfriend of yours? 
JERRY: So what do you write, children’s books?
JERRY: All right...
JERRY: I gotta get to the airport.
JERRY: The uh toilet brush is under the sink.
JERRY: I don’t really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because there’s that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, you’re sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, “I’m really sorry about this. I don’t know why I left that stuff over there.” And that’s why I could never be a maid, because I’d have an attitude. I’d find them, wherever they are in the house, “Oh, I suppose you couldn’t do this? 
JERRY: He really did an amazing job. Look! 
JERRY: Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? 
JERRY: Where are you going?
JERRY: Oh wait. I’ll go with you.
JERRY: Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole!
JERRY: Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.
JERRY: Shouldn’t you be out on a ledge somewhere?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: I think that’s the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!
JERRY: I had a statue!
JERRY: My grandfather gave me a statue!
JERRY: I can’t believe it! 
JERRY: Yes! 
JERRY: Pretty sure! 
JERRY: Coincidence? 
JERRY: I had a statue! 
JERRY: I’ll call Kramer. He can check my house.
JERRY: Don’t worry. (whispering into the phone) Kramer! 
JERRY: Ma, I told you, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan... Okay, bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Rava) My mother. She forgot how to make French toast. You know how mothers are.
JERRY: My mom’s down in Florida. She’s got uh one of those condos. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?
JERRY: Listen, uh I just remembered... I’m... uh, getting a facial.
JERRY: No, I don’t eat dinner. Dinner’s for suckers.
JERRY: Uh huh... Yeah... Okay, thanks anyway... Bye.
JERRY: Nope, the cop says it’s my word against his. There’s nothing they can do.
JERRY: Yeah, right.
JERRY: Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? 
JERRY: I’ll call him. (Jerry picks up the cordless phone. He points to the rotary phone on the coffee table. 
JERRY: Relax, he’s late. He’s always late. It’s part of his M.O.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Don’t worry about it.
JERRY: That’s comforting. Shh. He’s coming. (to Ray) Ray?
JERRY: Well, I didn’t...
JERRY: Well, just give it back, and I won’t say anything.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: What are you talking about?
JERRY: Yeah, me too.
JERRY: Me.
JERRY: Yeah. Me.
JERRY: Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house – and then I saw it in your house.
JERRY: What am I saying?
JERRY: Well, I...
JERRY: I can’t believe what I’m hearing.
JERRY: A pawn shop?
JERRY: Oh, excuse me... Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.
JERRY: No, she’s a little too cheery for me.
JERRY: I know Finland. They’re neutral.
JERRY: No, I actually find you quite charming. A bit verbose at times...
JERRY: (to George) Did you call me a wuss?
JERRY: I said luss. I’m at a luss.
JERRY: That’s not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table repeatedly.) You know, maybe it’s not that bad an idea.
JERRY: George...
JERRY: George, george...
JERRY: Hey, Ray.
JERRY: How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? 
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: Can’t you talk to your boss?
JERRY: Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..
JERRY: All right, all right. What’s the big hubbub, bub?
JERRY: Kramer, what did you do?
JERRY: People are going to steal from you. You can’t stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? 
JERRY: You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one: as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? 
JERRY: (Trying to read the note) What have I done? 
JERRY: Johnny? 
JERRY: I don't know. 
JERRY: I don't think that's it.
JERRY: What does that mean?
JERRY: Oh, he's having a heart attack.
JERRY: C'mon.
JERRY: Oh, this is ridiculous.
JERRY: I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it.
JERRY: (To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.
JERRY: So what do you want? 
JERRY: I'll call an ambulance. (Exits)
JERRY: Well? 
JERRY: "Salami salami bologna"?
JERRY: (Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how ya doin' buddy? 
JERRY: (Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?
JERRY: Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..
JERRY: No, I tried it on. It fits good.
JERRY: Well, you know..
JERRY: Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?
JERRY: Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.
JERRY: You know, if your future was a little more certain..
JERRY: Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? 
JERRY: (Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? 
JERRY: (Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?
JERRY: Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.
JERRY: (Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.
JERRY: Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: (Trying to shut him up) Kramer.
JERRY: Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.
JERRY: (Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.
JERRY: Well, for one think, don't listen to him.
JERRY: Eckman? 
JERRY: A rebel? 
JERRY: George, you need a medical doctor.
JERRY: Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? 
JERRY: Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.
JERRY: (Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.
JERRY: Sorry.
JERRY: (He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.
JERRY: (Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here..
JERRY: Too much dairy? 
JERRY: I love crampbark.
JERRY: Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.
JERRY: Couchgrass and crampbark? 
JERRY: Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? 
JERRY: (To Assistant) Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.
JERRY: (To Assistant) I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?
JERRY: You're gonna fight?
JERRY: (Pleading) Really, gentlemen, please.
JERRY: All this for a Chuckle.
JERRY: It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.
JERRY: You just can't leave him out there.
JERRY: How ya doing? 
JERRY: Hey, check the TV.
JERRY: (Pulls the note out of his pocket) That's it! 
JERRY: I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? 
JERRY: What are you doing? 
JERRY: He was good in Man From Uncle.
JERRY: I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.
JERRY: No, I don't wanna see the naked people.
JERRY: I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.
JERRY: I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)
JERRY: What?
JERRY: What look?
JERRY: I gave a look?
JERRY: What kind of look?
JERRY: Then what was it?
JERRY: Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: No. Things pop into your head. You?
JERRY: Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.
JERRY: I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? 
JERRY: Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)
JERRY: No big surprises.
JERRY: What do you think?
JERRY: Well, it's something to consider.
JERRY: I mean, let's say we did.
JERRY: Is that like the end of the world or something?
JERRY: Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
JERRY: I mean, really, what is the big deal? 
JERRY: It's moronic.
JERRY: Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.
JERRY: I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.
JERRY: Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)
JERRY: That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.
JERRY: But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.
JERRY: For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.
JERRY: But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.
JERRY: Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.
JERRY: Now here's another little rule.
JERRY: When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.
JERRY: Well now we're gettin' somewhere.
JERRY: Tough one. You're call.
JERRY: Fine. Well.
JERRY: You ready?
JERRY: So think you can handle this?
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Not yet.
JERRY: I haven't been out yet.
JERRY: No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?
JERRY: Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.
JERRY: I thought you'd like that.
JERRY: I know.
JERRY: No, I can't do details.
JERRY: I can't give details.
JERRY: I'm not in the mood.
JERRY: All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.
JERRY: On the couch.
JERRY: No, separated.
JERRY: Around eleven.
JERRY: So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.
JERRY: And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.
JERRY: It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.
JERRY: Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.
JERRY: She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.
JERRY: Not exactly.
JERRY: Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat)
JERRY: I think we've worked out a system.
JERRY: No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls.
JERRY: Okay. No calls the next day.
JERRY: You ready for the second one?
JERRY: Spending the night. Optional.
JERRY: No, that's the rule. It's optional.
JERRY: I think you're wrong.
JERRY: Is this yours or the roommate's?
JERRY: Would she mind?
JERRY: Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.
JERRY: Well, guess I'll get going.
JERRY: Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.
JERRY: I don't understand. Is there a problem? 
JERRY: I'm having surgery tomorrow.
JERRY: But you said, it can be very serious.
JERRY: What happened to the rules? 
JERRY: It has nothing to do with whose house it is.
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: I can't go if you're mad.
JERRY: You seemed a little mad.
JERRY: So you're okay with everything?
JERRY: Definitely. Well, goodnight.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.
JERRY: No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.
JERRY: You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.
JERRY: I think I heard her say something about a bench.
JERRY: I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I have no idea.
JERRY: Forget the bench.
JERRY: No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.
JERRY: Nice looking fellow.
JERRY: Too romantic.
JERRY: Too sexual.
JERRY: Too domestic.
JERRY: Too Gubernatorial. 
JERRY: Maybe you won't like it.
JERRY: You could not like it.
JERRY: Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)
JERRY: Would do you think?
JERRY: Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?
JERRY: Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.
JERRY: I said, "and more."
JERRY: What's wrong with pal? 
JERRY: Great.
JERRY: Well goody for you.
JERRY: 182 bucks.
JERRY: Could you excuse us please?
JERRY: We're talking.
JERRY: You know, we never had one fight before this deal.
JERRY: Never.
JERRY: We got along beautifully.
JERRY: It was wonderful.
JERRY: So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.
JERRY: You what?
JERRY: You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. Hmmm. What do you want?
JERRY: Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?
JERRY: (Starts to correct then realizes) Well...
JERRY: I never should have made up those rules.
JERRY: It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: What did you end up giving her?
JERRY: Sorry about that.
JERRY: Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.
JERRY: Could be it.
JERRY: She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...
JERRY: We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.
JERRY: Plus, you know what else.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: And the other.
JERRY: Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, "Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. 
JERRY: She's the performance artist, right?
JERRY: What's her husband's name, again? 
JERRY: Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.
JERRY: C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something.
JERRY: Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions.
JERRY: Thin ice, George. Thin ice..
JERRY: (Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? 
JERRY: Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?
JERRY: (To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.
JERRY: What ever happened with the shirt?
JERRY: Asked you? 
JERRY: Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.
JERRY: But?
JERRY: Lyme disease? 
JERRY: How did she get Lyme disease?
JERRY: They still do that play?
JERRY: With all the nudity?
JERRY: Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.
JERRY: Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?
JERRY: There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?
JERRY: When is this suppose to be?
JERRY: 'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! 
JERRY: And if you do?
JERRY: Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.
JERRY: (Pleading) Leave me alone.
JERRY: I'm not getting illegal cable!
JERRY: No, I read in the paper..
JERRY: Well, they might hook us up again.
JERRY: Stop shouting! 
JERRY: What you're suggesting is illegal.
JERRY: It's against the law.
JERRY: (Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?
JERRY: A real human rights nut, huh?
JERRY: I don't know. What if I get caught?
JERRY: You know, why don't we wait? 
JERRY: (Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..
JERRY: (Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in.
JERRY: Seinfeld.
JERRY: My cable hook-up? 
JERRY: It has? 
JERRY: Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! 
JERRY: Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?
JERRY: What's with this airline? 
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?
JERRY: I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, "This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here."
JERRY: Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.
JERRY: Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.
JERRY: No, really.. an airport run.
JERRY: (Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.
JERRY: Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.
JERRY: You want to get a bite?
JERRY: Well, so what should we do?
JERRY: Red shirt! 
JERRY: You're wearing the chocolate shirt!
JERRY: A - Ha! 
JERRY: What are you gonna do? 
JERRY: And what if we go up there? 
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: You'll never say that to her face.
JERRY: The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.
JERRY: Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.
JERRY: I'm sorry, I..
JERRY: (Stammering) Oh, I, I, think I remember..
JERRY: Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..
JERRY: No, I don't think that..
JERRY: Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.
JERRY: No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble..
JERRY: (Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred dollars! 
JERRY: Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?
JERRY: What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? 
JERRY: Evry-Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. 
JERRY: What do you think the worst part of being blind is?
JERRY: You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?
JERRY: I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? 
JERRY: You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?
JERRY: He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.
JERRY: Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.
JERRY: Who takes care of your boy during the day?
JERRY: No no. I'm just saying.
JERRY: Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em.
JERRY: (about the massage)You know I think this is really helping.
JERRY: So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.
JERRY: Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.
JERRY: I'm in the middle of a story.
JERRY: Well it’s not like it's a really funny story or anything.
JERRY: Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.
JERRY: Yes, it was.
JERRY: I know it was stupid.
JERRY: Hey, I just said it was stupid.
JERRY: Take it.
JERRY: Hey, would you stop it already?
JERRY: I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.
JERRY: Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Not if you have a doctor's note.
JERRY: Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.
JERRY: I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.
JERRY: No appointments at all? 
JERRY: What's with you?
JERRY: Yes, A...?
JERRY: Yes, a man gave you...?
JERRY: So?
JERRY: That's a massage.
JERRY: You took your pants off?
JERRY: Oh.
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: Moved?
JERRY: I'm sure it didn't move.
JERRY: Maybe it just wanted to change positions? 
JERRY: Okay, so what if it moved?
JERRY: That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact.
JERRY: That's what a gym teacher once told me.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Joe DiMaggio? 
JERRY: No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.
JERRY: I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.
JERRY: He can have a donut,
JERRY: …but not at Dinky.
JERRY: I never said I'd do that.
JERRY: I don't know how I feel about it.
JERRY: Alright, alright.
JERRY: ...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.
JERRY: I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all.
JERRY: If he does.
JERRY: He feels funny. You don't have to do this.
JERRY: Roy, should we go? 
JERRY: What is the matter with you?
JERRY: You don't have to, really.
JERRY: We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? 
JERRY: Well what about the week after?
JERRY: No appointments at all? 
JERRY: Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? 
JERRY: Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.
JERRY: Uh huh.
JERRY: See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.
JERRY: What happened to you?
JERRY: Hello? 
JERRY: I told you.
JERRY: I told you we shouldn't do it.
JERRY: He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? 
JERRY: Yeah, you, me and George.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: You what?
JERRY: Why'd you do that?
JERRY: Of course I was getting you a note.
JERRY: Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors.
JERRY: Hi Pam.
JERRY: I just thought ahh maybe I could talk to Roy, if um…
JERRY: Hi Roy.
JERRY: I don't even know what to say.
JERRY: I knew this would happen.
JERRY: I mean the whole thing, it's just...
JERRY: Well it's not tragic.
JERRY: No, it's...
JERRY: Okay. I mean, what if the--
JERRY: I'm not happy.
JERRY: I mean I'm happy sometimes, but-but not now.
JERRY: Yeah, college was fun.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Oh please, I love her.
JERRY: Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now?
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Hi. Ah look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna.
JERRY: Yeah, I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her.
JERRY: You don't understand, ah…
JERRY: Wait a second, don't you--
JERRY: Hi. Hi. Look, I don't know what you think --
JERRY: --but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is inadvertently sent an insurance--
JERRY: Can't you just listen to me?
JERRY: The police?
JERRY: Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.
JERRY: Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention, Elaine laughs) Maybe it's time you got a different hobby.
JERRY: Did he say anything?
JERRY: Having a cup of coffee.
JERRY: Wow. Look at him. The Yankee Clipper…
JERRY: …here.
JERRY: What causes homophobia? 
JERRY: I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? 
JERRY: Hey, there's the old man! 
JERRY: Ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.
JERRY: What's the difference?
JERRY: I don't wanna use your car.
JERRY: Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
JERRY: So what would you do? 
JERRY: I don't know. 25 bucks a day.
JERRY: Oh, I didn't get the insurance.
JERRY: You're not paying for it.
JERRY: God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?
JERRY: It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
JERRY: (ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.
JERRY: The lake isn't real.
JERRY: I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.
JERRY: Ma.
JERRY: (to Morty) What about you?
JERRY: (to Helen) What about him?
JERRY: Na, that's not such a good idea.
JERRY: Not now. She's right inside.
JERRY: I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.
JERRY: Well...
JERRY: Shh! 
JERRY: (tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggage, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? 
JERRY: I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.
JERRY: I'm going for the record.
JERRY: Oh, come on.
JERRY: Nice to see you. This is Elaine.
JERRY: We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.
JERRY: For fun.
JERRY: I don't think so.
JERRY: What kind of pen is that?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Wow! 
JERRY: Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.
JERRY: Oh no.
JERRY: I couldn't
JERRY: I can't take it.
JERRY: No, I'm not...
JERRY: I cannot take it!
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!
JERRY: Thanks again.
JERRY: What he gave it to me.
JERRY: He offered it to me.
JERRY: I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
JERRY: He could have said: "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.
JERRY: If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.
JERRY: Well, he was wrong.
JERRY: So you want me to return it?
JERRY: Hey I don't even want the pen now!
JERRY: Are you O.K. in here?
JERRY: It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.
JERRY: Oh you wanna switch? 
JERRY: Oh, no don't say that. You'll jinx me.
JERRY: They're nuts with temperature.
JERRY: How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?
JERRY: It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
JERRY: Stay on Biscayne.
JERRY: Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.
JERRY: What's so special up here?
JERRY: Then YOU would be hunched over.
JERRY: You can't go?
JERRY: Without you? 
JERRY: You sure?
JERRY: We'll stay in a hotel tonight.
JERRY: Why don't you get a new sofa?
JERRY: I'm buying you a new sofa.
JERRY: Hi. How are you?
JERRY: Evelyn, this is Elaine.
JERRY: Too thin?
JERRY: (Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What?
JERRY: I never really wanted the pen.
JERRY: No, no, I...
JERRY: All I said was "I like the pen".
JERRY: Don't be alarmed.
JERRY: I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.
JERRY: (to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?
JERRY: Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
JERRY: Well I started to go under...
JERRY: Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.
JERRY: I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
JERRY: Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.
JERRY: I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to Jack)
JERRY: Take it.
JERRY: What is going on in this community! 
JERRY: Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?
JERRY: Well. This should be a very interesting evening.
JERRY: (Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.
JERRY: Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)
JERRY: (to Leo) Uncle Leo.
JERRY: I've got a black eye.
JERRY: Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
JERRY: (to Stella) Her back hurts.
JERRY: No, no.
JERRY: Dad!
JERRY: (in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.
JERRY: (to himself) Oh God! 
JERRY: (still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?
JERRY: Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?
JERRY: All I said was I liked the pen!
JERRY: There must be some mistake.
JERRY: (to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...
JERRY: Nothing.
JERRY: Hi Evelyn.
JERRY: Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
JERRY: Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? 
JERRY: So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? 
JERRY: Is he on the plane now?
JERRY: Uh, just my next door neighbor.
JERRY: Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?
JERRY: What's the matter?
JERRY: Huh? 
JERRY: Farfel?
JERRY: The dog? 
JERRY: But, you know, what if, you know?
JERRY: The dog?
JERRY: Let go, Farfel! 
JERRY: Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.
JERRY: Do I what?
JERRY: Yes, I pick it up.
JERRY: Well you have to.
JERRY: No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first.
JERRY: I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.
JERRY: I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.
JERRY: Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! 
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: You're breaking up?
JERRY: I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
JERRY: Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.
JERRY: You. I'm talking about people.
JERRY: No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.
JERRY: Sure.
JERRY: What do you need me for?
JERRY: No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!
JERRY: I can't go.
JERRY: Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.
JERRY: He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.
JERRY: No, I don't want that smell in the house.
JERRY: No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.
JERRY: Nah. You two go.
JERRY: Go ahead.
JERRY: I want to but I can't.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.
JERRY: Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!
JERRY: On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?
JERRY: Bad dog! 
JERRY: That's right, Gavin Palone. What? 
JERRY: Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.
JERRY: Going to the dog pound, everybody! 
JERRY: What am I supposed to do? 
JERRY: I'm in the book and I have a machine.
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.
JERRY: Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.
JERRY: What are you doing?
JERRY: Kramer? 
JERRY: Well.
JERRY: everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah?
JERRY: Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.
JERRY: It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.
JERRY: I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?
JERRY: Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.
JERRY: She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
JERRY: I don't know, regular human time?
JERRY: Why shouldn't I go here?
JERRY: Oh yeah, urinals are fun. 
JERRY: So what are calling me six times a day?
JERRY: I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
JERRY: It is? 
JERRY: Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.
JERRY: I don't know what to do.
JERRY: I know, I know.
JERRY: It is kind of silly.
JERRY: I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.
JERRY: It's not like she's *in* the movie.
JERRY: Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? 
JERRY: How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? 
JERRY: Saving movies.
JERRY: Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.
JERRY: You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.
JERRY: Oh, hi Ellen.
JERRY: Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...
JERRY: Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
JERRY: Why don't we just rent a movie?
JERRY: No, it&Mac226;s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i...
JERRY: Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.
JERRY: You and George got together?
JERRY: Hello.
JERRY: What's up?
JERRY: About what?
JERRY: Too bad.
JERRY: Prognosis Negative.
JERRY: It's not.
JERRY: I have an instinct for these things.
JERRY: I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? 
JERRY: Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?
JERRY: No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.
JERRY: Big accomplishment.
JERRY: Five o'clock.
JERRY: You're not late.
JERRY: Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.
JERRY: There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.
JERRY: You got the picnic and burger traffic.
JERRY: I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?
JERRY: (CONT'D) You want me to help you with that?
JERRY: (TO GEORGE, RE:WOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?
JERRY: I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.
JERRY: It's over there. I know where it is.
JERRY: (CONT'D) Hmmm...I thought it was...
JERRY: I thought it was over there.
JERRY: I really have to go to the bathroom.
JERRY: I'll wait.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.
JERRY: (TO KRAMER, RE:BOX) Will you let me help you with that?
JERRY: You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?
JERRY: Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, "Make sure you hang on to your jacket."
JERRY: Maybe it's not on this level.
JERRY: There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?
JERRY: You should always carry a pad and pen.
JERRY: Where was the bathroom in this mall? 
JERRY: All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?
JERRY: His eyes look a little cloudy.
JERRY: Who's got the tickets? 
JERRY: No one's going to do that.
JERRY: Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?
JERRY: It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.
JERRY: I know.
JERRY: No I can't.
JERRY: You think I'm too cautious?
JERRY: Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.
JERRY: He's a comedian.
JERRY: All right. All right.
JERRY: I can manage.
JERRY: Okay, okay. I'll be right back.
JERRY: But...
JERRY: (STARTS TO LEAVE, TO HIMSELF) ...Kramer
JERRY: I've had this condition since I was eleven! 
JERRY: So you don't care if I die.
JERRY: It was life and death.
JERRY: Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? 
JERRY: Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. 
JERRY: (C0NT'D) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? 
JERRY: First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.
JERRY: Oh really, do you? 
JERRY: (CONT'D) And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.
JERRY: You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.
JERRY: (A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.
JERRY: (CONT'D) What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.
JERRY: (TO GEORGE) Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?
JERRY: Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? 
JERRY: Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.
JERRY: I was arrested for urinating.
JERRY: I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.
JERRY: No, but he's not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR)
JERRY: Hey, where's Kramer?
JERRY: Where's Kramer?
JERRY: Hey George, there she is again. ...
JERRY: Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.
JERRY: Filthy pigs.
JERRY: Jerry.
JERRY: Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.
JERRY: The car!
JERRY: Kramer!
JERRY: Kramer.
JERRY: Yeah, over here.
JERRY: This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.
JERRY: What's that smell? 
JERRY: Manly.
JERRY: So why didn't you say no?
JERRY: Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.
JERRY: That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
JERRY: I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.
JERRY: All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.
JERRY: Who thinks you're smart?
JERRY: What thing?
JERRY: Oh, Oh, the IQ thing...yeah.
JERRY: What'd ya get?
JERRY: What do you say?
JERRY: 1409, that's a good score.
JERRY: What did you really get?
JERRY: Of course.
JERRY: I hope so.
JERRY: He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in.
JERRY: I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for  survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for  him for a second.
JERRY: Well, it's a spider.
JERRY: Bazooka Joe.
JERRY: The buzzer.
JERRY: My house? 
JERRY: Come on up.
JERRY: What's that?
JERRY: Come on, Go in, go in! 
JERRY: No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him.
JERRY: You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.
JERRY: Casus belli.
JERRY: Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test?
JERRY: Oh, it's nothing...
JERRY: Why must you always be the focal point of attention? 
JERRY: This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.
JERRY: No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.
JERRY: You know, I don't even know my IQ.
JERRY: Get out of here!
JERRY: You get out of here!
JERRY: Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test.
JERRY: Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? 
JERRY: Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.
JERRY: Hey, I love a good caper.
JERRY: Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it.
JERRY: Eh, people, people are talking.
JERRY: Ah, non-smoking would be great.
JERRY: Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.]
JERRY: Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?
JERRY: Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years.
JERRY: (thinks) Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? 
JERRY: Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.
JERRY: Oh, please...
JERRY: Eat something! 
JERRY: Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: So?
JERRY: Why not?
JERRY: Statute.
JERRY: Statute of limitations. It's not a statue.
JERRY: Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.
JERRY: Oh my God.
JERRY: Go ahead, I'll take care of it.
JERRY: It's all right, she was cheating anyway.
JERRY: Babu, you're Pakistani, right?
JERRY: Babu, may I say something?
JERRY: I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? 
JERRY: Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.
JERRY: Well, you know; not everything. I do what I can.
JERRY: The average person in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.
JERRY: Of course, I always do.
JERRY: Hey Georgie!
JERRY: Well, well, well...
JERRY: Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.
JERRY: Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles...
JERRY: But an 85?
JERRY: Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.
JERRY: Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I'm sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.
JERRY: I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.
JERRY: Let me tell you something Babu. You go back in that kitchen -- tell your chef I want the works.
JERRY: Babu? 
JERRY: Well, maybe your refrigerator...
JERRY: No I...
JERRY: Well I...
JERRY: You know, I think I'll just take the check.
JERRY: (thinking) Bad man? 
JERRY: You know what it was, bad location.
JERRY: Aren't you cold? 
JERRY: Oh, sorry.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: 151?
JERRY: So, what are you up for? 
JERRY: You know, what would be great?
JERRY: ....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant? 
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: (sarcastically) No you don't..
JERRY: My show from last night.
JERRY: Yeah , I was doing new material.
JERRY: Huh?
JERRY: The" coup dé-toe"
JERRY: Yeah!
JERRY: Nothin'.....nothing at all.
JERRY: Who you calling?
JERRY: China really?
JERRY: What for?
JERRY: Hair?
JERRY: Done what?
JERRY: (to Kramer) What's this?
JERRY: Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.
JERRY: It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.
JERRY: Good question.
JERRY: If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.
JERRY: Tell her. I wanna hear her reaction.
JERRY: The Chinese , the Chinese bald cure.
JERRY: No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald cure.
JERRY: Hey! 
JERRY: Remember Peter?
JERRY: You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this jockey and the jockey got off the horse and started chasin' him.
JERRY: Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?
JERRY: She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults. Things you would know very little about.
JERRY: Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.
JERRY: No I can't she didn't leave her name or number.
JERRY: Sure.
JERRY: I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.
JERRY: Why are you doing this?
JERRY: Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?
JERRY: Well yes I did that's true. A couple of a guys I knew in the coastguard told me about her.... and I sensed that she had the anger and intensity that I needed to make this film work.
JERRY: (as Ping rambles on ) ...S'cuse me (Ping looks up) Kind of an expensive call.
JERRY: ..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye. HA Ha..Who do these women think they're dealing with? 
JERRY: That's my cockney accent.
JERRY: Lets hear yours.
JERRY: That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! 
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: Yes I am skeptical.
JERRY: Make sure you get this area here, where he needs the help....
JERRY: Happy camper , I don't hear that expression enough.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: No kidding?
JERRY: What happened to the jacket. Did he take it with him?
JERRY: You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?
JERRY: How long are you suppose to leave it on for?
JERRY: Hello.
JERRY: Well Hello..
JERRY: Yes , I got her number.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: I don't know , Who keeps track of Hellos.
JERRY: She's coming up.
JERRY: Yeah. What's wrong, why? 
JERRY: I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.
JERRY: The big toe; The captain.
JERRY: The captain of the toes. (phone rings) Hello.
JERRY: Okay....too bad.
JERRY: Soon as I get off the phone wih you.
JERRY: okay , bye (to George) What happened , did you take it off?
JERRY: That's it, you gave up?
JERRY: That was Elaine , she changed her mind. She's not coming over.
JERRY: Hello is this Alicia? 
JERRY: This is Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY: (to Kramer) ...( words missing)...laugh , everything's nice and at the end of the night I go for a little contact. I get the PULL BACK. This woman said the filthiest things I've ever heard in my life. I get the Pull Back.
JERRY: Yeah..
JERRY: Come on up . (looks at his watch) ...What's he doing here now?
JERRY: She must be psychotic or something.
JERRY: I'm not giving you her number.
JERRY: What are doing here now?
JERRY: What's up?
JERRY: So just start it.
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: Kramer, let's do this later.
JERRY: Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please.
JERRY: It's kinda private.
JERRY: Does she know?
JERRY: How did it happen?
JERRY: Well, why can't you say it?
JERRY: So how can you promise her?
JERRY: What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?
JERRY: What, Elaine?
JERRY: (picks up the headphones) That was Elaine...
JERRY: Wait a second. .Just give me a second
JERRY: Okay, Okay, I promise. 
JERRY: Oooh! 
JERRY: What are you doing here?
JERRY: I know, George told me.
JERRY: Where did you come up with all that stuff?
JERRY: George I'm telling ya..
JERRY: Aye......
JERRY: It's early.
JERRY: I met her on an elevator.
JERRY: Impossible, right?
JERRY: I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.
JERRY: You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.
JERRY: Can you believe I did that?
JERRY: Not a good sign.
JERRY: You got something in your teeth there.
JERRY: It's green.
JERRY: Did you bump into anybody you knew?
JERRY: How'd it go?
JERRY: What do you need a job, you got Audrey.
JERRY: What's the matter?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Too late for that.
JERRY: Yeah, she's got a big nose.
JERRY: It's a schnoz.
JERRY: A little.
JERRY: Stop being so concerned with looks.
JERRY: Have you said anything to her about it?
JERRY: Alright, shut up, here they come.
JERRY: Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.
JERRY: We have time.
JERRY: It is exciting.
JERRY: Please, please, Isabel? 
JERRY: Then what?
JERRY: She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.
JERRY: (holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.
JERRY: So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.
JERRY: I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.
JERRY: It's not like that at all.
JERRY: Alright, are we ready? 
JERRY: Shouldn't a doctor do it?
JERRY: Great job.
JERRY: Let's put him over here.
JERRY: Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!
JERRY: You're lying! 
JERRY: Give it to me!
JERRY: Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.
JERRY: I was lying, give it to me!
JERRY: I want that number!
JERRY: I'm Nelson!
JERRY: Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time.
JERRY: Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.
JERRY: (to himself: Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.
JERRY: Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.
JERRY: So I assume the jig was up.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Do you believe this? 
JERRY: I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.
JERRY: They cross the wires or something.
JERRY: They stole my car.
JERRY: They did.
JERRY: What should I do, should I call the police?
JERRY: I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.
JERRY: Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.
JERRY: Are you serious?
JERRY: I don't even know if I remember the number.
JERRY: What do I say if he picks up?
JERRY: Hello? 
JERRY: Can I ask you a question?
JERRY: Did you steal my car?
JERRY: That's my car!
JERRY: What are you gonna do with it?
JERRY: Then can I have it back?
JERRY: (derisively at Kramer) Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?
JERRY: Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?
JERRY: Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.
JERRY: Sid left the keys in the car.
JERRY: He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.
JERRY: He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.
JERRY: Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.
JERRY: The whole block, forty, fifty cars.
JERRY: Hey Sid, what happened?
JERRY: You left the keys in the car?
JERRY: Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.
JERRY: This Wednesday?
JERRY: But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
JERRY: Hello? 
JERRY: Owen March, I never heard of him.
JERRY: Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.
JERRY: What's that?
JERRY: Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.
JERRY: Sixty-six years old?
JERRY: Why do people always say that? 
JERRY: Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.
JERRY: I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?
JERRY: But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.
JERRY: I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.
JERRY: Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?
JERRY: Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? 
JERRY: Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.
JERRY: Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.
JERRY: Fine.
JERRY: Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.
JERRY: Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.
JERRY: Well that's what's important.
JERRY: How many times you been out with him?
JERRY: Face to face.
JERRY: If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.
JERRY: What is going on out there?
JERRY: So then what?
JERRY: That's great!
JERRY: You mean *a* career.
JERRY: No. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
JERRY: Oh my god.
JERRY: Boy, he took it hard.
JERRY: (on the phone) Hello? 
JERRY: (To Elaine) It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's unconscious.
JERRY: Kramer.
JERRY: Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?
JERRY: You raise the feet, get blood to the head.
JERRY: I don't have a washcloth.
JERRY: You can't put a paper towel on his head.
JERRY: How you gonna hold it on there?
JERRY: Should we walk him around?
JERRY: No, no that's for a drug overdose.
JERRY: Hey, you know what? 
JERRY: We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.
JERRY: Cookies don't liquefy.
JERRY: What blender? 
JERRY: I would know if I had a blender.
JERRY: (on phone) Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago.
JERRY: This is an emergency, what's taking so long? 
JERRY: Come on up. Okay, they're here.
JERRY: Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.
JERRY: Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?
JERRY: Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.
JERRY: Yeah, that's true.
JERRY: Yeah? 
JERRY: I could tell.
JERRY: Blue Escort? 
JERRY: What happened to the car?
JERRY: We don't know!
JERRY: So how'd you hit the car?
JERRY: It's not even my car, it's a rental.
JERRY: Can I get anybody anything?
JERRY: Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.
JERRY: (reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.
JERRY: (continuing) The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.
JERRY: (finishing) The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.
JERRY: Can he communicate?
JERRY: Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.
JERRY: What community? 
JERRY: All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.
JERRY: Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...
JERRY: That is right, somebody else was driving.
JERRY: Uh huh, what's that?
JERRY: Other drivers?
JERRY: Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?
JERRY: Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.
JERRY: Did you see the size of that document? 
JERRY: These pretzels are making me thirsty.
JERRY: An overdose of odor? 
JERRY: Ahh.
JERRY: Let me get that.
JERRY: Please.
JERRY: (sarcastically) Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.
JERRY: What are you doing here?
JERRY: Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.
JERRY: I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going "I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? 
JERRY: Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.
JERRY: Well what do you think? 
JERRY: I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?
JERRY: It was a gift.
JERRY: If they like each other.
JERRY: See that guy he's talking with? 
JERRY: Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.
JERRY: You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.
JERRY: Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
JERRY: I think it's off the wagon.
JERRY: What am I doing here? 
JERRY: Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.
JERRY: Under the sofa cushion.
JERRY: It's your Christmas present.
JERRY: Cranberry juice?
JERRY: So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)
JERRY: Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.
JERRY: There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?
JERRY: Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.
JERRY: I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.
JERRY: I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.
JERRY: Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?
JERRY: Yeah. She would love cashmere.
JERRY: Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
JERRY: Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater)
JERRY: It's hard to say.
JERRY: Well I can see it.
JERRY: Well what do you want me to do? 
JERRY: It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
JERRY: You want me to take an overview?
JERRY: I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.
JERRY: Yeah so?
JERRY: Oh boy, can you smell it?
JERRY: Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
JERRY: Yes you do.
JERRY: Yes you would.
JERRY: I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
JERRY: Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
JERRY: I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.
JERRY: I don't smell anything.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Come on up.
JERRY: Kramer. Yeah that'll do.
JERRY: I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.
JERRY: (uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: Ahem. Say that again?
JERRY: Do I see it... or don't I? 
JERRY: Now what did you ask me again.
JERRY: You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? 
JERRY: Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.
JERRY: It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
JERRY: Convulsing?
JERRY: I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
JERRY: You don't drink.
JERRY: So you started drinking.
JERRY: So how was it?
JERRY: Good thing the cleaning lady was there.
JERRY: You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.
JERRY: What are you saying?
JERRY: You're saying something.
JERRY: Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
JERRY: Well why don't you say it?
JERRY: What did you say?
JERRY: Yeah?
JERRY: Come on up.
JERRY: No I didn't.
JERRY: I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.
JERRY: Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.
JERRY: Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
JERRY: I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.
JERRY: Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.
JERRY: In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
JERRY: On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?
JERRY: They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
JERRY: I know enough not to get on them.
JERRY: George?
JERRY: George?
JERRY: I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
JERRY: I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
JERRY: Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.
JERRY: Get off of me.
JERRY: But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.
JERRY: Don't get smart.
JERRY: Remember, don't whistle on the elevator.
JERRY: That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.
JERRY: What time is the lesbian wedding?
JERRY: I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)
JERRY: Oh, I'm paying for breakfast?
JERRY: Why do I always pay? 
JERRY: So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? 
JERRY: Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.
JERRY: So what do you say? 
JERRY: All right, biff. Elaine, merry-go-round?
JERRY: Kramer, bumper-cars?
JERRY: Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to rides alone.
JERRY: O-K. You realize of course, you're naked?
JERRY: You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
JERRY: I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?
JERRY: All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.
JERRY: I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory.
JERRY: That's your problem, you should be.
JERRY: Don't get up, please, allow me.
JERRY: I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting.
JERRY: Defence? 
JERRY: Franco's no good? 
JERRY: But you gotta like their chances.
JERRY: Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.
JERRY: First we ride the cyclone.
JERRY: Aah, French fries.
JERRY: No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.
JERRY: You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!
JERRY: You want him?
JERRY: So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!
JERRY: Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?
JERRY: Yeah, it's in the kitchen drawer.
JERRY: Come on, I'll go with you.
JERRY: Were you talking? 
JERRY: Oh, Noel! 
JERRY: All right, I'm sorry. What about her?
JERRY: I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
JERRY: We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.
JERRY: Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...
JERRY: That smells good, what is that?
JERRY: The *beach*?
JERRY: Yeah... So's shock therapy.
JERRY: You don't know?
JERRY: You think they have fleas there, don't you?
JERRY: Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there.
JERRY: They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
JERRY: What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?
JERRY: [quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! 
JERRY: Is this okay? 
JERRY: I dunno, it was an impulse.
JERRY: How could I know she would start to laugh?
JERRY: Can we just go in already?
JERRY: What about?
JERRY: I know, but I'm distracted now.
JERRY: Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?
JERRY: "Cut to the chase"?
JERRY: What're you, "Joe Hollywood"?
JERRY: I would lose that.
JERRY: "Lose that"? 
JERRY: Really, an intervention ...
JERRY: Me? 
JERRY: Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...
JERRY: We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)
JERRY: You play a *Hell* of a piano.
JERRY: Pez?
JERRY: Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
JERRY: Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
JERRY: We'll be outside
JERRY: It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?
JERRY: You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
JERRY: A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? 
JERRY: What happened? 
JERRY: All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.
JERRY: He's the same!
JERRY: Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?
JERRY: Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.
JERRY: What do you think? 
JERRY: Yeah
JERRY: Yeah, but John invited her.
JERRY: No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.
JERRY: Stop smelling your arm.
JERRY: Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, "That's not a bad idea."
JERRY: Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.
JERRY: She broke up with you?
JERRY: What was on the list?
JERRY: Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,
JERRY: What's wrong with lunch?
JERRY: A preemptive breakup.
JERRY: In the freezer.
JERRY: Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
JERRY: Do I have to talk? 
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Intervention.
JERRY: No, we're having an intervention
JERRY: There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.
JERRY: It's NOT a surprise party! 
JERRY: Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.
JERRY: We're having the intervention for Richie.
JERRY: Well, uh..
JERRY: Well, you're looking well.
JERRY: I didn't know she would laugh.
JERRY: Hey Richie
JERRY: It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.
JERRY: So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table
JERRY: He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them
JERRY: Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.
JERRY: So as he's telling the story he starts crying.
JERRY: What do you think? 
JERRY: Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.
JERRY: I can't do those things.
JERRY: Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?
JERRY: What are you doing? 
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. You’ve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?
JERRY: I think I’ll take out the garbage.
JERRY: Well, once I didn’t have dinner until, like 9:00 o’clock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage – meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya’? 
JERRY: Come on, it’s just down the hall.
JERRY: I’ll give you 50 cents.
JERRY: Come on. Fifty cents. 
JERRY: I don’t get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? 
JERRY: Nah, I don’t go for these non-refundable deals. I can’t commit to a woman. I’m not going to commit to an airline.
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Gina, do you know what a Drake’s Coffee Cake is?
JERRY: How much do they cost?
JERRY: No, no the junior.
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: Boy she’s sexy isn’t she?
JERRY: Do you believe that guy?
JERRY: My neighbour:
JERRY: Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?
JERRY: What’s so amazing? 
JERRY: What was the dream?
JERRY: I think I’ve played there.
JERRY: You’re a little paranormal
JERRY: Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?
JERRY: Alright, come on, lets get out of here.
JERRY: I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
JERRY: Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.
JERRY: Who is it? 
JERRY: Who?
JERRY: Martine?
JERRY: Oh, Martin!
JERRY: What?
JERRY: In my pajamas? 
JERRY: It’ll take two seconds.
JERRY: We don’t have two seconds?
JERRY: Nah, forget it.
JERRY: Nah. I’ll just wear the pajamas.
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: Nah, I’ll go get the robe.
JERRY: That’s not too bad. It’s not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
JERRY: He said that?
JERRY: I’m sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
JERRY: You weren’t?
JERRY: Of course.
JERRY: Are you sure he can’t hear anything? 
JERRY: I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how they’re going to look at a thing like this.
JERRY: No, I just wanted to see what time it was.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Here?
JERRY: Is this the proper venue?
JERRY: No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.
JERRY: I can’t. What if he wakes up?
JERRY: A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guy’s got a coma going like this … you don’t want to mess with it.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Yeah, I heard.
JERRY: Who told you about Martin?
JERRY: Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?
JERRY: You know I don’t get that whole suicide machine. There’s no tall buildings where these people live? 
JERRY: Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
JERRY: So we’re in the room and she’s trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.
JERRY: Nothing.
JERRY: I didn’t know what the coma etiquette was.
JERRY: So you’re saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, it’s all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.
JERRY: So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, he’s thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, there’s nothing left?
JERRY: You can say what you want about me but I’ll be damned if I’m going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
JERRY: No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
JERRY: They’re a comedy team.
JERRY: Well, they’re three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.
JERRY: I will show you The Stooges.
JERRY: Well, I don’t really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.
JERRY: Well, uh, I uh, I don’t want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe it’s not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.
JERRY: Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
JERRY: Yeah, all right. All right.
JERRY: Hello Newman.
JERRY: Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? 
JERRY: Boy, it’s a good thing we came.
JERRY: George, I want you to promise me something. If I’m ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.
JERRY: Looters.
JERRY: She’s really hungry.
JERRY: Hello.
JERRY: How’s he doing?
JERRY: Why wouldn’t he?
JERRY: He’ll have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
JERRY: How up to date?
JERRY: And nothing could change your mind?
JERRY: Drake’s Coffee Cake
JERRY: From my house. I got a whole box of them.
JERRY: That’s your big boy.
JERRY: I don’t give out bites. I got another one. But I’m saving it for later.
JERRY: I don’t think so. You know they, they’re so fragile.
JERRY: You swear?
JERRY: On your mother’s life?
JERRY: Elaine! 
JERRY: Hey!
JERRY: What are you doing? 
JERRY: What did she name the kid?
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: osh.
JERRY: Woah. (hitting George)
JERRY: Wow! 
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!
JERRY: Oh, it’s an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.
JERRY: Yeah, it’s some place down in the village.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: All right we’re coming down.
JERRY: We’re taking Elaine to dinner. She’s got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?
JERRY: Oh, yes you will.
JERRY: Yeah, maybe you won't.
JERRY: Are my nostrils getting bigger?
JERRY: Oh, so there's still hope.
JERRY: Oh, so hopelessness is the key.
JERRY: Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.
JERRY: Went out with George, you?
JERRY: How was it? 
JERRY: We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.
JERRY: George too.
JERRY: I've never fixed anybody up.
JERRY: Well why wouldn't you start with George? 
JERRY: Well you implied it.
JERRY: Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?
JERRY: He's George!
JERRY: So what?
JERRY: I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?
JERRY: I went out with you.
JERRY: Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.
JERRY: Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.
JERRY: Yeah, come on, it's a good match.
JERRY: Naturally.
JERRY: Everything.
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: She's good looking.
JERRY: Very good looking.
JERRY: Really very good looking.
JERRY: Yes, I would take her out.
JERRY: What hesitate? 
JERRY: I'm telling you, she's good looking.
JERRY: Good body, nice body.
JERRY: Nice.
JERRY: Pretty nice.
JERRY: Really very nice and good.
JERRY: Good personality. Funny. Bright.
JERRY: How could she be smarter than you?
JERRY: You know, long dark hair.
JERRY: Flowing?
JERRY: 'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?
JERRY: Just clarifying.
JERRY: Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?
JERRY: I think you'll get it out.
JERRY: She's got a fine cheek.
JERRY: A pinkish hue?
JERRY: There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.
JERRY: I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.
JERRY: I think it's tamber.
JERRY: I didn't notice the voice.
JERRY: So, Saturday night.
JERRY: She could have mentioned the conversation.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Oh, the guy from Jersey?
JERRY: No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.
JERRY: So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?
JERRY: Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?
JERRY: Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.
JERRY: Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
JERRY: Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.
JERRY: You can tell me, I'll vault it.
JERRY: I'm locking the vault. What?
JERRY: Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?
JERRY: At your apartment?
JERRY: She didn't stay over?
JERRY: So, what did she have to say?
JERRY: He said they had a good time.
JERRY: Oh, good.
JERRY: Nope. You?
JERRY: You sure?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah. Okay then.
JERRY: Goodnight.
JERRY: Well, I'm gonna do something about this.
JERRY: Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.
JERRY: I'm gonna call her.
JERRY: No, I'm calling her.
JERRY: No, forget it, I'm gonna call.
JERRY: Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.
JERRY: George, do you wanna fight? 
JERRY: I'll just call her when you leave!
JERRY: It is so my business!
JERRY: Yeah, but--
JERRY: But Kramer--
JERRY: Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! 
JERRY: Ow! 
JERRY: Oh, hi. Soda?
JERRY: So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? 
JERRY: Oh, I know her. I know her type.
JERRY: The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!
JERRY: I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.
JERRY: Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!
JERRY: I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?
JERRY: I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?
JERRY: Get your finger out of my face.
JERRY: I don't care.
JERRY: Acting.
JERRY: Thank you. Hi Cynthia.
JERRY: Well this is a great place to sit you got here.
JERRY: So what are these?
JERRY: I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.
JERRY: That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.
JERRY: You chuck.
JERRY: Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.
JERRY: Believe me I didn't see anything.
JERRY: No, did you?
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.
JERRY: All right
JERRY: All right
JERRY: You know who that is? 
JERRY: Yeah, that's him.
JERRY: Positive.
JERRY: Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.
JERRY: So Biff wants to be a buff? 
JERRY: Hey, should we say something to him?
JERRY: well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.
JERRY: So?
JERRY: I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: What I do? 
JERRY: Thank you.
JERRY: I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.
JERRY: I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.
JERRY: Oh. that would be great.
JERRY: It's been three days and he hasn't called.
JERRY: I can't ... I can't
JERRY: I don't know. I just feel he should call me.
JERRY: You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.
JERRY: I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?
JERRY: I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.
JERRY: Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?
JERRY: What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? 
JERRY: Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!
JERRY: Oh, they don't have phones out of town? 
JERRY: I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?
JERRY: For what dinner?
JERRY: Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? 
JERRY: ... this is all .. very confusing.
JERRY: Elaine, how about this shirt? 
JERRY: Oh, see the baby again with the baby..
JERRY: Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby.
JERRY: (imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape?
JERRY: uh uh because then it would be all grown up.
JERRY: Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?
JERRY: I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.
JERRY: Uh, Keith uh Hernandez.
JERRY: Hellooo Newman.
JERRY: Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
JERRY: Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.
JERRY: What happened to your head when you got hit?
JERRY: Again
JERRY: Back and to the left Back and to the left
JERRY: I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.
JERRY: But that is not what they would have you believe.
JERRY: The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
JERRY: No. What happened to you?
JERRY: I'm Vandelay Industries?
JERRY: And what is that?
JERRY: Latex? 
JERRY: And what do I say about you?
JERRY: I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
JERRY: I don't think so. Why would I do that?
JERRY: If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: All right we're coming down.
JERRY: Yeah, come on Elaine, lets go.
JERRY: That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
JERRY: Well that was really fun, thanks.
JERRY: Well, ...
JERRY: No, I haven't.
JERRY: Sure, that would be great.
JERRY: I mean, ... if you want to.
JERRY: Yeah, Friday's okay.
JERRY: Well, good night [holds hand out and shakes hand]
JERRY: Elaine?
JERRY: Uh, I don't know, we used to go out.
JERRY: For a date?
JERRY: Oh, no, uh, go ahead. You got a pen?
JERRY: .... (silence)
JERRY: So then we went to dinner.
JERRY: We split it.
JERRY: Naw, I gotta wait until its just the right time.
JERRY: Yeah
JERRY: Come on up.
JERRY: Uh, nuthin'. Then he took me home.
JERRY: (smiling) Yeah
JERRY: Good shake. Perfect shake. Single pump, not too hard, you know, doesn't have to prove anything, but, you know, firm enough to know he was there.
JERRY: He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.
JERRY: So then as I was getting out of the car, ...
JERRY: Hi Elaine.
JERRY: What date? 
JERRY: Already?
JERRY: I don't mind at all. Why should I mind? 
JERRY: Oh, ya' going?
JERRY: Ah, really.
JERRY: Friday?
JERRY: He's going' out with you on Friday?
JERRY: He's supposed to see ME on Friday.
JERRY: We made plans.
JERRY: No, don't cancel it.
JERRY: Well, frankly it is.
JERRY: Well you're not even a fan. I was at game six - you didn't even watch it.
JERRY: Any Hennigans around here?
JERRY: Vandelay Industries, Kel Varnsen speaking. May we help you? 
JERRY: No. No. I don't mind at all.
JERRY: Sure, we can do something next week.
JERRY: No, its no problem at all.
JERRY: Okay, take it easy. (hangs up) That was Keith. we're going to do something next week.
JERRY: Hey what are you doing Friday night?
JERRY: Friday night? 
JERRY: Fasten your seat belts. we're goin' to see the baby.
JERRY: All right, I'll go
JERRY: And you want to be my latex salesman.
JERRY: (to baby) Hello. How are you/
JERRY: Yes. I do love her. (to baby) You have a very nice place here.
JERRY: He's joking.
JERRY: I was saying the same thing.
JERRY: Uh, you don't have to take a picture.
JERRY: Jerry, You want to pick her up?
JERRY: I better not.
JERRY: I don't know him. I know who he is.
JERRY: I know. He got the hit in game SIX. So, so then what happened?
JERRY: … You know
JERRY: No!
JERRY: Did he kiss you good night?
JERRY: What do you mean you don't know?
JERRY: Well, what kind of a kiss? 
JERRY: So, you like him.
JERRY: Ah, I'm jealous of everybody.
JERRY: hello. Oh, hi. What's happening? 
JERRY: That was Keith.
JERRY: He wants me to help him move.
JERRY: You know, furniture.
JERRY: I said yes, but I don't feel right about it. I mean I hardly know the guy. That's a big step oin a relationship. The biggest. That's like going all the way.
JERRY: Well we went out one time. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
JERRY: Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.
JERRY: … I said yes.
JERRY: I'm NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT! 
JERRY: hey Kramer do me a favour .
JERRY: Don't mention it to anybody.
JERRY: She likes him I mean she really likes him.
JERRY: Who wouldn't like him? 
JERRY: Forget that. He's a ball player. MVP< 1979. I'm making wise cracks in some night club. This guy was in game six. They're a perfect match. They like go together. They're like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.
JERRY: You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that.
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: I don't know … six three.
JERRY: So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these types of people.
JERRY: Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on.
JERRY: DeSoto? 
JERRY: Oh. like they wouldn't have found that anyway.
JERRY: No I can't I've got some stuff to do then I've got to meet Keith at my apartment at three. I'm helping him move.
JERRY: I know isn't that something?
JERRY: I don't know … he's got some valuable antiques, He's worried they'll break something.
JERRY: Is there a box spring?
JERRY: Is there a box spring?
JERRY: Is that a sectional?
JERRY: Is that a thick marble?
JERRY: I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.
JERRY: I told you!
JERRY: But why? 
JERRY: Hello, … oh hi Elaine .. what's going on … no he just left … you broke up with him? 
JERRY: You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?
JERRY: Well Biff/ What's next?
JERRY: George.
JERRY: Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?
JERRY: Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.
JERRY: So you have no car?
JERRY: So what good are you?
JERRY: I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.
JERRY: He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.
JERRY: Yeah, right.
JERRY: He's definitely in Chicago.
JERRY: How would we do it?
JERRY: Maybe he knows O'Brien?
JERRY: What if we get caught?
JERRY: Who's gonna be O'Brien?
JERRY: Who am I?
JERRY: Just me?
JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?
JERRY: Dylan Murphy.
JERRY: What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?
JERRY: You could be Colin.
JERRY: I'm Dylan Murphy.
JERRY: Come on,
JERRY: Colin?
JERRY: What for?
JERRY: She happy for you?
JERRY: No. Why?
JERRY: He can't hear us.
JERRY: Where's he dropping us? 
JERRY: What?
JERRY: We're going to the Knick game!
JERRY: I can't believe it! 
JERRY: Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.
JERRY: Elaine? 
JERRY: Maybe it's a shortcut.
JERRY: (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?
JERRY: It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.
JERRY: It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? 
JERRY: First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.
JERRY: I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?
JERRY: It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.
JERRY: I'm Seinfeld!
JERRY: We're doing sixty miles an hour!
JERRY: Who are you, Mannix?
JERRY: Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.
JERRY: No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.
JERRY: Newsletter?
JERRY: Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?
JERRY: Never seen a picture of him?
JERRY: Not even on the book jacket?
JERRY: (nudging George) Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.
JERRY: (checking his watch) I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
JERRY: He tends to exaggerate.
JERRY: Well you might as well look it over.
JERRY: You're not going to open with that, are you?
JERRY: Nice looking Lugar.
JERRY: What's taking him so long out there?
JERRY: She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!
JERRY: Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?
JERRY: Let's just make a run for it.
JERRY: How'd that happen?
JERRY: I know, why do they make that bed so tight? 
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.
JERRY: I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
JERRY: Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.
JERRY: We were right on the border.
JERRY: Get in the car! 
JERRY: No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.
JERRY: It's safer! 
JERRY: Oh look at this guy.
JERRY: Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.
JERRY: No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? 
JERRY: Give me that wave!
JERRY: Yeah, I'm free, why?
JERRY: Oh my God! 
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.
JERRY: I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice)
JERRY: Wait, he stopped, he's parking.
JERRY: Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.
JERRY: So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.
JERRY: You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.
JERRY: He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh)
JERRY: Let's not even analyze it.
JERRY: I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
JERRY: Friday night.
JERRY: Yep.
JERRY: Come on up.
JERRY: By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
JERRY: Oh, you dig?
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
JERRY: Look, she slammed into a parked car! 
JERRY: On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? 
JERRY: What am I drinking, milk?
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Thank you.
JERRY: With that?
JERRY: What car?
JERRY: Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.
JERRY: Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)
JERRY: Yeah, Queens.
JERRY: So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! 
JERRY: So I said to him, "Whatever's necessary."
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Oh, it was nothing.
JERRY: Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. 
JERRY: I know a little.
JERRY: He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.
JERRY: Ah, nah! 
JERRY: Australia?
JERRY: But not anymore.
JERRY: Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.
JERRY: We just met.
JERRY: Ask George to go with you.
JERRY: Why do you even need anybody?
JERRY: Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.
JERRY: Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
JERRY: Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.
JERRY: The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? 
JERRY: Come on up.
JERRY: No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.
JERRY: What if she's having an off night?
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: A stupid what?
JERRY: You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.
JERRY: Entertainment Tonight's on.
JERRY: Bedroom.
JERRY: What's it like out?
JERRY: Can I take a sweater?
JERRY: Scarf?
JERRY: What's the matter? 
JERRY: Get together?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: What car?
JERRY: Yeah who?
JERRY: The blond with the blue sweatpants! 
JERRY: The blond with the blue sweatpants!
JERRY: I've had a crush on this woman for year! 
JERRY: Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? 
JERRY: I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!
JERRY: Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.
JERRY: There should be more people like us.
JERRY: You're telling me.
JERRY: Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.
JERRY: Thank you very much.
JERRY: Let me rephra-
JERRY: Hi Elaine, this is Angela.
JERRY: Well I think I get the gist of it.
JERRY: What car?
JERRY: It's not complicated.
JERRY: Alright Elaine.
JERRY: It was just a couple of blocks.
JERRY: It's not that hard.
JERRY: Hold it! 
JERRY: A matador! 
JERRY: Eduardo, Carochio! 
JERRY: Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.
JERRY: $875?
JERRY: Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.
JERRY: Um, who do I make it out to?
JERRY: So, what are you doing this weekend?
JERRY: I didn't do it!
JERRY: You are soo good lookin'.
JERRY: You sure you want to do this? 
JERRY: Alright!
JERRY: What did I do?
JERRY: I-
JERRY: I didn't do it! 
JERRY: No, never.
JERRY: Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
JERRY: I like the button fly.
JERRY: That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. It’s like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you doing today?
JERRY: I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?
JERRY: There’s nothing to get.
JERRY: She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.
JERRY: She sees something in him.
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: I don't know how long this is gonna last.
JERRY: I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)
JERRY: Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.
JERRY: (walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!
JERRY: (to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
JERRY: May I? 
JERRY: What's this?
JERRY: (sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.
JERRY: They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!
JERRY: Is he okay?
JERRY: This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? 
JERRY: How you feeling?
JERRY: (pointing) There's George!
JERRY: It's preposterous! 
JERRY: Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.
JERRY: Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
JERRY: That's what she told me!
JERRY: That's what it costs!
JERRY: I wasn't thinking! 
JERRY: Well, she framed it and everything.
JERRY: Do you want me to paint you something? 
JERRY: (looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!
JERRY: (reading note) Oh my god!
JERRY: This is amazing, you can't believe this!
JERRY: Listen to this: "I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."
JERRY: (reading on) "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. 
JERRY: No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!
JERRY: Should I?
JERRY: ALL RIGHT, all right! 
JERRY: SHOT! 
JERRY: Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.
JERRY: The appeal of the posse? 
JERRY: Yeah?
JERRY: Come on up.
JERRY: ...Yeah.
JERRY: She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing to George) He likes the pop-in, too.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: HUGE pop-in guy!
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Okay!
JERRY: If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!
JERRY: (tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! 
JERRY: Let go!
JERRY: Let go, Elaine!
JERRY: Oh, George can't click! 
JERRY: Wait, wait a second! 
JERRY: (on to something) Wait a second... 
JERRY: This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!
JERRY: I always thought there was something funny about this letter! 
JERRY: What are you talking about? 
JERRY: How's it coming?
JERRY: Seen any good movies lately?
JERRY: No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? 
JERRY: I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?
JERRY: I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...)
JERRY: Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
JERRY: Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?
JERRY: What are you talking about?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Oh yeah, I know.
JERRY: What's the difference?
JERRY: You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
JERRY: If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?
JERRY: You have to know, you must know.
JERRY: Well, I'm not telling you.
JERRY: Nope. I don't think so.
JERRY: Not today, pal.
JERRY: Now see? 
JERRY: Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.
JERRY: I loaned the car to George.
JERRY: Huh?
JERRY: I don't know! 
JERRY: *I* don't like you!
JERRY: Why not?
JERRY: Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes.
JERRY: No, I like Mike.
JERRY: Oh yeah? 
JERRY: Oh yeah? 
JERRY: No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?
JERRY: Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.
JERRY: Please, don't make me beg.
JERRY: Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
JERRY: Kramer!
JERRY: Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
JERRY: I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!
JERRY: He what?
JERRY: A phony? 
JERRY: Yeah, under the counter. What happened?
JERRY: (bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.
JERRY: He is?
JERRY: My god, are you okay?
JERRY: Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
JERRY: Where's George now?
JERRY: What are you talking about?
JERRY: (leaning out the window) Hey Georgie!
JERRY: Are you okay?
JERRY: Crazy kids, huh?
JERRY: Oh, hey Mike.
JERRY: I'm coming down.
JERRY: Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.
JERRY: Yeah, he's a real phony.
JERRY: Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana.
JERRY: Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.
JERRY: Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
JERRY: I didn't know.
JERRY: I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
JERRY: You're right. My fault.
JERRY: It was a so-so sorry.
JERRY: Wild pack of teenagers, huh?
JERRY: Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.
JERRY: Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,
JERRY: I thought you said you were a good driver!
JERRY: I think you said driver.
JERRY: Hey Sid.
JERRY: Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.
JERRY: What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?
JERRY: Hey Matthew.
JERRY: How ya doing?
JERRY: Hey, how's your father? 
JERRY: Oh no, nothing.
JERRY: No, no, no, no.
JERRY: No, of course not, of course not!
JERRY: I didn't--
JERRY: (to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?
JERRY: Mike thinks I'm a phony.
JERRY: Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.
JERRY: I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
JERRY: Open my vault?
JERRY: Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.
JERRY: Oy ga-vault.
JERRY: Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? 
JERRY: Well if he's going then I'm not going.
JERRY: I still don't have to go.
JERRY: Why? 
JERRY: Like you didn't call me a phony?
JERRY: Use it in a sentence.
JERRY: Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?
JERRY: You scared me!
JERRY: That's enough!
JERRY: Kramer! 
JERRY: Get out! 
JERRY: C'mon!
JERRY: Move it! 
JERRY: Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?
JERRY: Oh. I see. There he is! 
JERRY: The murderers! 
JERRY: Did you see the look on that guy's face?
JERRY: Kramer! 
JERRY: All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.
JERRY: What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.
JERRY: No, come on!
JERRY: It was sold out!
JERRY: That's the point.
JERRY: Just, look, just give the keys.
JERRY: Don't ask me!
JERRY: I'm telling you.
JERRY: I'm serious!
JERRY: Yes it will, now give me those keys!
JERRY: So put 'em in a safe place.
JERRY: Where?
JERRY: I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.
JERRY: I can't.
JERRY: Who's there?
JERRY: Elaine...
JERRY: Take the keys.
JERRY: O.K.!
JERRY: Your spare set?
JERRY: You want 'em back?
JERRY: Did you bring the keys?
JERRY: This could be an emergency!
JERRY: I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)
JERRY: They lost.
JERRY: Kramer?
JERRY: Hello, Newman.
JERRY: Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!
JERRY: You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?
JERRY: Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!
JERRY: Turn around, George.
JERRY: Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? 
JERRY: Where's Kramer?
JERRY: We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
JERRY: Bad rap?
JERRY: Me?
JERRY: L.A.?
JERRY: I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! 
JERRY: Huh?
JERRY: No, what'd you say?
JERRY: Oh, you didn't see it.
JERRY: I heard you say something, there.
JERRY: I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? 
JERRY: She's drunk out of her mind.
JERRY: Don't feel right? 
JERRY: What is the big deal?
JERRY: First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.
JERRY: Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)
JERRY: George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!
JERRY: Do you wanna fight?
JERRY: Don't you see? 
JERRY: What's that?
JERRY: I heard something.
JERRY: Well, this is great.
JERRY: They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What do they look like."
JERRY: Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.
JERRY: By Elaine Benes?
JERRY: Elaine's writing a "Murphy Brown"?
JERRY: Wait a second! 
JERRY: All right, here!
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: It was funny!
JERRY: Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...
JERRY: I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.
JERRY: I did not!
JERRY: Elaine, wait! 
JERRY: Good!
JERRY: Good! 
JERRY: Is that something you want to do?
JERRY: Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! 
JERRY: What did you say?
JERRY: I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! 
JERRY: Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.
JERRY: That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus?
JERRY: I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers.
JERRY: Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? 
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Sure.
JERRY: Hello.
JERRY: George-
JERRY: Oh thank you very much.
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: I'd be very interested in something like that.
JERRY: Okay. Great. Thanks.
JERRY: Thank you.
JERRY: Nice meeting you.
JERRY: They said they were interested in me.
JERRY: You know, a TV show.
JERRY: Yeah, I guess so.
JERRY: Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.
JERRY: Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?
JERRY: But gymnastics is not for everybody.
JERRY: So what?
JERRY: Yeah and...?
JERRY: What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?
JERRY: So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? 
JERRY: No they're not, they used to be.
JERRY: Oh like you do.
JERRY: A circus?
JERRY: I don't think so.
JERRY: I don't think the network will go for it.
JERRY: Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.
JERRY: Hello Newman.
JERRY: What's this all about?
JERRY: I didn't know you had a motorctcle.
JERRY: You have a girlfriend?
JERRY: I never remember you with a girl.
JERRY: This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: You know you're getting gypped over here.
JERRY: Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!
JERRY: Does that thing work?
JERRY: ... I just got a postcard from Elaine?
JERRY: Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.
JERRY: No, nothing.
JERRY: What do you need salsa for?
JERRY: You know why? 
JERRY: What?
JERRY: (dismissing) Yeah, right.
JERRY: Just talking? 
JERRY: No story?
JERRY: You've got to have a story.
JERRY: And who is on the show? 
JERRY: You?
JERRY: So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?
JERRY: And who else is on the show?
JERRY: Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show.
JERRY: And it's about nothing?
JERRY: So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.
JERRY: "We"? 
JERRY: You want to go with me to NBC?
JERRY: What do we got?
JERRY: What idea?
JERRY: I still don't know what the idea is.
JERRY: Right.
JERRY: So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.
JERRY: (Nodding) I think you may have something there.
JERRY: So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.
JERRY: What do you mean you don't think so?
JERRY: I don't understand. What don't you like about it?
JERRY: Why not?
JERRY: You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.
JERRY: I don't understand what the big deal is.
JERRY: Whatever you want.
JERRY: You can't play Kramer.
JERRY: But you can't act.
JERRY: Okay, fine. We'll use Newman.
JERRY: Nothin' What do you want?
JERRY: Buyer beware.
JERRY: Karma Kramer?
JERRY: (To himself) Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? 
JERRY: You sure? 
JERRY: What, are you nervous?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: This was your idea!
JERRY: Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.
JERRY: I told you not to come.
JERRY: They'll give us water in there.
JERRY: Oh God, it's Joe Devola.
JERRY: This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.
JERRY: Oh God he saw me.
JERRY: Hey Joe! 
JERRY: Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD.
JERRY: Oh, no reason. You're into karate right?
JERRY: What are you doing here?
JERRY: AH, GOOD FOR YOU.
JERRY: Well, ...
JERRY: No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
JERRY: Kramer's party.
JERRY: No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.
JERRY: No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.
JERRY: Give my best to Hinckley.
JERRY: I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...
JERRY: Relax. Who are they?
JERRY: Course not.
JERRY: They're nobody.
JERRY: What about you?
JERRY: Why not you?
JERRY: Better.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Yeah, it's one of my favorites.
JERRY: Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?
JERRY: Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.
JERRY: Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-
JERRY: Go ahead.
JERRY: (To George) Well, it's not about nothing.
JERRY: Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.
JERRY: ..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.
JERRY: Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.
JERRY: Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.
JERRY: Well, something happens.
JERRY: (To Russell) How about this: I manage a circus..
JERRY: I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? 
JERRY: Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? 
JERRY: IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE!
JERRY: Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.
JERRY: No, no this is more important.
JERRY: No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.
JERRY: Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)
JERRY: And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.
JERRY: Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.
JERRY: I just a ssumed, ...
JERRY: Of course. How are you?
JERRY: Tell me what?
JERRY: Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second. Hello.
JERRY: Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.
JERRY: Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.
JERRY: Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up)
JERRY: Kramer, are you drinking that milk?
JERRY: What's the expiration date on that?
JERRY: The third?
JERRY: I think SHE saw it coming.
JERRY: Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.
JERRY: Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.
JERRY: What happened to you?
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Boy, that is some kick.
JERRY: Wow, Newman's helmet.
JERRY: Me, why?
JERRY: What does he want from me? 
JERRY: (going through couch cushions) Where the hell did I put this?
JERRY: The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? 
JERRY: All right, what is this?
JERRY: All right, very funny. I get it.
JERRY: Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.
JERRY: Your pants!
JERRY: Don't you know? 
JERRY: Go look at your face in the mirror.
JERRY: (pressing intercom) yeah?
JERRY: Come on up.
JERRY: You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?
JERRY: I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.
JERRY: From that woman at NBC?
JERRY: (pointing Kramer) He drank it.
JERRY: All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.
JERRY: How much was it to clean the vest?
JERRY: Can you get vomit out of suede?
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: You just said 'Yo-yo Ma'.
JERRY: He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.
JERRY: I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.
JERRY: That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?
JERRY: Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! 
JERRY: (interrupts) What are you doing? 
JERRY: NBC! 
JERRY: I don't know about sixty.
JERRY: Ted Danson! 
JERRY: Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!
JERRY: You know, I think he wears a piece.
JERRY: I'm ten minutes slow again! 
JERRY: Yeah! 
JERRY: I'll pay for it.
JERRY: Well, what is it you object to? 
JERRY: Uncle Leo!
JERRY: Hello there, how're you doing?
JERRY: Good, good.
JERRY: Good, fine.
JERRY: Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.
JERRY: (not enthousiastic at all) Oh, sure. Danny.
JERRY: Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember.
JERRY: (interrupts) I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.
JERRY: We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.
JERRY: (seems sincere) Yeah, I'm really sorry, uh.
JERRY: I'm sorry, really.
JERRY: Sorry, really.
JERRY: You see the look on my uncle's face? 
JERRY: You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go: 'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.'
JERRY: Why didn't you shave this morning?
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: Is that Joe Davola?
JERRY: I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.
JERRY: Oh.
JERRY: All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? 
JERRY: Wouldn't tune in.
JERRY: No tune.
JERRY: Just a huge massive coronary.
JERRY: He couldn't believe it.
JERRY: We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.
JERRY: Your off-Broadway play.
JERRY: (backs his story) Hmm, hmm.
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: Yeah!
JERRY: Now, all we gotta do is write it.
JERRY: Thanks.
JERRY: Thank you, thanks.
JERRY: Phone call? 
JERRY: Bye thanks.
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: She did, you insisted.
JERRY: Nah!
JERRY: oh, I d-I don't know. I d---
JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: Thirteen thousand.
JERRY: No, for both!
JERRY: Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?
JERRY: You're nuts!
JERRY: He's somebody.
JERRY: You're nobody.
JERRY: He's good, you're not.
JERRY: You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola!
JERRY: Outside! 
JERRY: Go outside and see if he's still there.
JERRY: Well, what are we supposed to do? 
JERRY: Good idea.
JERRY: Thanks.
JERRY: (back in booth) He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life.
JERRY: (bossy) What are you doing?
JERRY: What, are you ordering food now?
JERRY: What happened to the muffin?
JERRY: All of a sudden you get hungry?
JERRY: No! 
JERRY: All of a sudden he gets hungry.
JERRY: I know!
JERRY: Do you see him?
JERRY: Well, either you see him or you don't.
JERRY: (looking at the cop) What is he doing? 
JERRY: (still bossy) Did you just order coffee?
JERRY: This is really too much.
JERRY: Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.
JERRY: Hey you guys!
JERRY: What are you doing here?
JERRY: Hey, is Davola outside?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Eleven dollars for what?
JERRY: (to Kramer) Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: (looking outside) Hey Newman, is that your red car?
JERRY: I think you're getting a ticket.
JERRY: Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.
JERRY: Oh, like you know what you're talking about!
JERRY: It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? 
JERRY: Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.
JERRY: She's okay.
JERRY: She's nice.
JERRY: She's all right.
JERRY: She's not beautiful.
JERRY: So you ask her out.
JERRY: Why not?
JERRY: She's pretty. She's not beautiful.
JERRY: I think that's a little extreme.
JERRY: Ah, very good.
JERRY: No thanks, just the check.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Come on.
JERRY: What am I gonna say?
JERRY: Well, you made me uncomfortable.
JERRY: In the back, on your right.
JERRY: Dad!
JERRY: Will you let me pay just once.
JERRY: How you gonna pay? 
JERRY: What're you gonna do?
JERRY: Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. (standing) I'm going to the bathroom.
JERRY: Uh, yeah. (broaching a subject) Hey uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to a meeting.
JERRY: So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh?
JERRY: Oh, heh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.
JERRY: Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one.
JERRY: (pulling Leo back in) Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you.
JERRY: Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here!
JERRY: Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred!
JERRY: Aww, right. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it!
JERRY: Yeah, I think I do.
JERRY: (under his breath) This is unbelievable.
JERRY: I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.
JERRY: Oh. (chuckles) Really? 
JERRY: Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin?
JERRY: They eat fish.
JERRY: How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? 
JERRY: I know, I know.
JERRY: I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.
JERRY: I woulda taken you to the airport.
JERRY: Neither do I. (to intercom) Yeah?
JERRY: Come on up. (to parents) It's George.
JERRY: Ah, George turned it down.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Because of Ted Danson.
JERRY: (fetching a drink from the fridge) Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.
JERRY: What about NBC? 
JERRY: Heyy! 
JERRY: Aww...
JERRY: ...C'mon.
JERRY: So what'd we get?
JERRY: Beautiful!
JERRY: Lemme see if I understand this. In other words, you held out
JERRY: You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go... up.
JERRY: You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.
JERRY: (to intercom) Yeah?
JERRY: Alright, we're coming down.
JERRY: Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you.
JERRY: A present.
JERRY: C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one.
JERRY: Ah hah, alright, let's go.
JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: (pointedly) Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars.
JERRY: Hey, uncle Leo.
JERRY: How you doing?
JERRY: This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.
JERRY: Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money?
JERRY: Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip.
JERRY: Take care now. So long.
JERRY: Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet.
JERRY: He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it.
JERRY: ...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? 
JERRY: She hasn't told her father yet?
JERRY: "We're"? 
JERRY: You're meetin' the father for the first time?
JERRY: (Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.
JERRY: (Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it: Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..
JERRY: No, but wait, wait: And then you dump them off onto Kramer..
JERRY: (Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! 
JERRY: (Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.
JERRY: (Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.
JERRY: (Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.
JERRY: What, you got a problem with the pen now?
JERRY: Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.
JERRY: (Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.
JERRY: No, no thank you.
JERRY: Act I, Scene A..
JERRY: (Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? 
JERRY: Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Okay, how about this: I'm in my apartment, you come in.
JERRY: Here we go.
JERRY: Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: (Looking at his watch) You got four hours! 
JERRY: (Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?
JERRY: (Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? 
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Why? 
JERRY: (Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.
JERRY: I really think you're making too much of this.
JERRY: Let me walk you to a cab.
JERRY: I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.
JERRY: (Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.
JERRY: So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?
JERRY: I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. 
JERRY: I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..
JERRY: So we go back to my apartment..
JERRY: So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.
JERRY: (Modest) Oh, you know, the usual..
JERRY: Typical things.
JERRY: She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply)
JERRY: ..And then she starts talking about her panties.
JERRY: So I said something.
JERRY: (Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.
JERRY: Okay? 
JERRY: (Throwing up his hands) I don't know! 
JERRY: She flipped out! 
JERRY: Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.
JERRY: She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? 
JERRY: I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
JERRY: (Getting up) Alright, big work day.
JERRY: Let's go.
JERRY: Right now.
JERRY: You and me.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: (Reading from his notebook) I got: You enter, you go "Hi", and I go, "Hello." Now.. we need something here..
JERRY: Come in, we're taking a break.
JERRY: Yeah!
JERRY: (Stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. (Approaches the intercom) C'mon, let's get it together.. (Through intercom) Yeah?
JERRY: C'mon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine)
JERRY: (Agreeing) Yeah, we should.
JERRY: Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?
JERRY: Oh.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Well, then, you've just got to fire her! 
JERRY: Talk? 
JERRY: Yes.
JERRY: Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself.
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Ah, just - takin' a little break.
JERRY: (Looking at his watch ) Yeah..
JERRY: Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, and, (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly exiting) time.
JERRY: (Waving good bye) We'll see ya.
JERRY: Alright, let's go.
JERRY: Right now.
JERRY: You and me.
JERRY: No foolin'
JERRY: (Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say "Hi", and I say "Hello".
JERRY: Yeah.. 
JERRY: (Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that line?
JERRY: Did you write it down?
JERRY: Okay.. (Opens the door to a frantic Elaine)
JERRY: Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?
JERRY: So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything?
JERRY: (Smiling to himself) Beautiful.
JERRY: Oh, no, not beautiful.
JERRY: Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that.
JERRY: (Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-
JERRY: (Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell smoke?
JERRY: Oh, how you doing? 
JERRY: Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your..
JERRY: Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the check to Elaine) look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.
JERRY: (Moving back into the living room) Okay.
JERRY: About what?
JERRY: Nah, I don't wanna go.
JERRY: I-I-I don't like the opera. What are they singing for? 
JERRY: All right, all right.
JERRY: So why don't they talk like that now?
JERRY: Yeah?
JERRY: Come on up.
JERRY: I don't know
JERRY: Hi!
JERRY: So I finally get to meet your pal Joey.
JERRY: Oh, good, men love that!
JERRY: Hey!
JERRY: Ooo, could be from that blonde
JERRY: (shouting) Kramer what am I going to do did you hear that that guy's gonna put a kibosh on me he's crazy he's out of his mind....
JERRY: I'm gonna call the cops. 
JERRY: What do you mean they're not going to do anything, they're the cops, they gotta do something, he just put the kibosh on me, do you know what the kibosh means, its a kibosh!
JERRY: I mean it's a terrible mistake, I mean he thinks I ruined some deal of his at NBC, I don't know anything about any deal at NBC.
JERRY: Oh, I got the machine.
JERRY: Nice!
JERRY: and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye.
JERRY: (on phone) But officer, he threatened me! 
JERRY: (cautiously) Who is it?
JERRY: Well, well, look at you. 
JERRY: Ooo, that was a bad toast.
JERRY: I never heard anybody curse in a toast.
JERRY: There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! 
JERRY: What do you mean not going? 
JERRY: Why doesn't she pay for hers?
JERRY: It's nice to get a reach.
JERRY: Who is it?
JERRY: Because of Divola! 
JERRY: You're going like this?
JERRY: I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!
JERRY: Well what about me! 
JERRY: Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours?
JERRY: Would you turn that down! 
JERRY: Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets.
JERRY: Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.
JERRY: Oh yeah right.
JERRY: All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll meet you in front of the theatre.
JERRY: You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?
JERRY: See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! 
JERRY: Well you should hear the message from my nut. Where's George and Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, I feel very vulnerable.
JERRY: I was just flipping it, it's mine.
JERRY: All right, do you want the quarter, take the quarter, but don't try and tell me it's yours.
JERRY: What, do you think I care about the money? 
JERRY: Yeah!
JERRY: I kinda like this opera crowd, I feel tough... Anybody else got a problem?
JERRY: Where are they already?
JERRY: Do you remember the curse toast?
JERRY: So, can you believe that message? 
JERRY: Crazy Joe Divola
JERRY: What do you mean? 
JERRY: I never told you his name.
JERRY: Joe Divola.
JERRY: How do you know his name?
JERRY: Oh my god, its Joe Divola
JERRY: That madman is trying to kill me.
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy.
JERRY: I'm telling you, the guy took.....
JERRY: That is one angry clown!
JERRY: The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. 
JERRY: (Singing) Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!
JERRY: Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. 
JERRY: Binaca?
JERRY: Come on, you gotta let us in
JERRY: We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.
JERRY: You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us.
JERRY: We thought he was with you.
JERRY: Boy, some cast, huh? 
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Susan! 
JERRY: Where's George?
JERRY: Uncomfortable? 
JERRY: Kramer, who'd you sell your ticket to?
JERRY: I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. 
JERRY: We're dead.
JERRY: We are dead.
JERRY: All day tomorrow? 
JERRY: Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?
JERRY: I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
JERRY: So what? 
JERRY: Hey, see those two women over there? 
JERRY: What is it your business?
JERRY: She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? 
JERRY: George, Marla.
JERRY: Stacey.
JERRY: George, Stacey.
JERRY: George.
JERRY: Trip to Berlin?
JERRY: Oh, right, right.
JERRY: Yes, yes, I did. 
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: Oh, did he like it?
JERRY: So, are you gonna go out with her?
JERRY: What about Susan?
JERRY: Depends.
JERRY: On many factors.
JERRY: Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? 
JERRY: What about Saturday nights? 
JERRY: She got anything in your medicine cabinet?
JERRY: Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?
JERRY: Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.
JERRY: You got yourself a girlfriend.
JERRY: I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...
JERRY: You're going to make a good father someday.
JERRY: Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?
JERRY: The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.
JERRY: Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?
JERRY: you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?
JERRY: (sarcastically) Oh, yeah.
JERRY: This is your plan?
JERRY: I don't think you are.
JERRY: Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.
JERRY: I don't think I am.
JERRY: Try me.
JERRY: Everything?
JERRY: You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?
JERRY: What are you doing?
JERRY: No.
JERRY: This is not a good time.
JERRY: What did you have to give your TV away to George for?
JERRY: Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)
JERRY: Marla, Kramer.
JERRY: Why don't you go out? 
JERRY: There's weather.
JERRY: I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: Kramer... (points to Marla)
JERRY: So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
JERRY: Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.
JERRY: Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?
JERRY: Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?
JERRY: Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.
JERRY: Snapple?
JERRY: Go on.
JERRY: Yes.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Hi, um. Marla, Elaine.
JERRY: Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.
JERRY: I like that thing in your hair there.
JERRY: So we'll talk about the hooks then?
JERRY: She's a virgin, she just told me.
JERRY: Well it's not like spotting a toupee.
JERRY: No, no, I mean...
JERRY: Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah?
JERRY: A virgin.
JERRY: I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.
JERRY: You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.
JERRY: Yeah, me too.
JERRY: All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you.
JERRY: All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.
JERRY: Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Your butler?
JERRY: What about me?
JERRY: (Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?
JERRY: What happened?
JERRY: Should I call an ambulance? 
JERRY: Yeah, here.
JERRY: (To George) You're givin' him back that TV.
JERRY: A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? 
JERRY: What do you mean? 
JERRY: No, no, would you get up?
JERRY: No.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)
JERRY: Hi, how are you doing? 
JERRY: Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?
JERRY: Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits)
JERRY: Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.
JERRY: Yeah, he just walked by.
JERRY: Yeah, good idea.
JERRY: Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.
JERRY: Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? 
JERRY: Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? 
JERRY: Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.
JERRY: So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?
JERRY: Would you give him the TV back?
JERRY: Why did he fire her?
JERRY: You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.
JERRY: You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.
JERRY: Couple of interviews.
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Why would I leave? 
JERRY: Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?
JERRY: Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.
JERRY: What else did you say to her?
JERRY: More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.
JERRY: What is that about leaving after sex? 
JERRY: I was trying to be.
JERRY: Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? 
JERRY: (To Elaine) Let me ask you a question. 
JERRY: You're a hostage, captured by terrorists- 
JERRY: You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry? 
JERRY: (To George) What's the matter? 
JERRY: "Caught" you? 
JERRY: Where? 
JERRY: "Glamour"? 
JERRY: So, what did she do? 
JERRY: What did you do? 
JERRY: (In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so. 
JERRY: "Glamour"? 
JERRY: (Skeptical) Ohhh yeah.. right. 
JERRY: No chance. 
JERRY: Well, I know I could hold out longer than you. 
JERRY: Sure, how much? 
JERRY: (Pointing) You're on. 
JERRY: You? 
JERRY: You'll be out before we get the check. 
JERRY: (Rejecting) Ohh, no. No, no, no.. 
JERRY: (Showing difference) It's apples and oranges.. 
JERRY: Because you're a woman! 
JERRY: It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man. 
JERRY: We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving. 
JERRY: (Nodding) Okay, one-fifty. 
JERRY: Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system. 
JERRY: (Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah? 
JERRY: How is she? 
JERRY: (Answering to the intercom) Yeah? 
JERRY: Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door) 
JERRY: (Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla. 
JERRY: Yeah. 
JERRY: Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead. 
JERRY: Where? 
JERRY: Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room? 
JERRY: What about the chamber maids? 
JERRY: (Over his shoulder) Not me. 
JERRY: There's a naked woman across the street. 
JERRY: (Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back. 
JERRY: (Still staring at the woman) Uh-huh. 
JERRY: Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door behind him) 
JERRY: "Slow it down"? 
JERRY: Ah, yeah.. I know. 
JERRY: Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? 
JERRY: (Smiling, nodding) Sure, Saturday night. 
JERRY: Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves) 
JERRY: (Out of it) Yeah, good morning. 
JERRY: She's not there. She's doin' her wash. 
JERRY: (Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did! 
JERRY: (Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my domain. But I will tell you this: I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down! 
JERRY: I can't take it anymore! 
JERRY: (Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way. 
JERRY: Look, I'm sorry- 
JERRY: Kramer, (Trying to pass him) get outta my way! 
JERRY: Alright.. (Takes his coat off) 
JERRY: ..Alright. 
JERRY: She's not there! 
JERRY: So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath? 
JERRY: Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital. 
JERRY: (Pointing) But are you still master of your domain? 
JERRY: Lord of the manor. 
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: (Adding, fake praise) Good one. 
JERRY: But the question is, are you still master of your domain? 
JERRY: Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up) 
JERRY: (Trying to block out Kramer, he starts to sing along with the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus.. 
JERRY: I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! 
JERRY: (Shouting) Come on up! 
JERRY: I don't know. 
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them! 
JERRY: They're my socks! 
JERRY: What are we doing here.. 
JERRY: This is ridiculous. 
JERRY: I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody. 
JERRY: It's over? 
JERRY: Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead. 
JERRY: What happened? 
JERRY: But you made it through the day before. 
JERRY: Why outside here? 
JERRY: Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me. 
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: You sure? 
JERRY: You really want to? 
JERRY: Okay.. 
JERRY: (Chuckles) You don't know the half of it. 
JERRY: Well, it's kinda silly, but.. 
JERRY: No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother- 
JERRY: I told her about the contest. 
JERRY: Marla? 
JERRY: (Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven! 
JERRY: Hey, could you do me a favour? 
JERRY: I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works: the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you?
JERRY: So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister...
JERRY: And here's the beauty--
JERRY: George is pickin' us up at the airport.
JERRY: You know that awning outside my building?
JERRY: He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.
JERRY: He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything.
JERRY: Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...
JERRY: Hey! 
JERRY: Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?
JERRY: Gimme ten.
JERRY: Well, we got three bags.
JERRY: That's what they get!
JERRY: Let's ask him.
JERRY: Let's see what he says.
JERRY: Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.
JERRY: Uh, how about a couple of people like us.
JERRY: C'mon, seriously...
JERRY: All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...
JERRY: You see? 
JERRY: We'll take 'em!
JERRY: Well, so what? 
JERRY: We'll call him...
JERRY: No time? 
JERRY: There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.
JERRY: I'll take the first class.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Elaine, have you ever flown first class?
JERRY: All right then. See? 
JERRY: Yeah, that's a point...
JERRY: Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.
JERRY: Bon voyage, Lainey!
JERRY: Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*!
JERRY: Oh my...
JERRY: Wow! 
JERRY: Uh-huh...
JERRY: Oh my... that *is* refreshing...
JERRY: Sounds lovely! 
JERRY: Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.
JERRY: Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? 
JERRY: I thought I smelled lilac.
JERRY: Oh, saffron! 
JERRY: Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? 
JERRY: Thank you...
JERRY: More everything!
JERRY: What is all the racket back there? 
JERRY: Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.
JERRY: Couldn't be...
JERRY: Where are they already? 
JERRY: Yeah, me too...
JERRY: Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business thing...
JERRY: Yeah. Where's George?
JERRY: No, you didn't.
JERRY: No she didn't.
JERRY: You walk around with no underwear?
JERRY: I do a wash.
JERRY: When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.
JERRY: You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.
JERRY: George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?
JERRY: You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? 
JERRY: No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman.
JERRY: Right, Dana Folley.
JERRY: She's the model I met on the plane.
JERRY: Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.
JERRY: What are you doing?
JERRY: The religious guy?
JERRY: Let us pray.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Kramer, should I call Susan?
JERRY: Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there.
JERRY: George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
JERRY: So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here.
JERRY: Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.
JERRY: What's that perfume you're wearing?
JERRY: What is that smell?
JERRY: It smells like the beach.
JERRY: Oh my God is that the new perfume?
JERRY: I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.
JERRY: And you're the model for this perfume?
JERRY: Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry pushes his door against Kramer's entrance]
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Yeah, uh, I'll see you later.
JERRY: All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! 
JERRY: NO! 
JERRY: Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference who's tall. We're all tall.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: (starting the Dust Buster) What smell?
JERRY: Oh, they're all the same. Here. [gives him Dust Buster] Now if you'll excuse us, ..
JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: I'll see you later.
JERRY: Ooow, that was close.
JERRY: I know look at this [shows ad]
JERRY: I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?
JERRY: Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.
JERRY: ... um ...
JERRY: Did you look at look at this picture carefully?
JERRY: Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.
JERRY: Here. Take a look. What, what is that?
JERRY: That's what I thought.
JERRY: DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE?
JERRY: Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.
JERRY: Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.
JERRY: Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.
JERRY: Okay. Thanks.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Everybody's got them.
JERRY: No, No, No, No, Oh, No.
JERRY: Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.
JERRY: It was a scratch.
JERRY: Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?
JERRY: Yeah?
JERRY: Come on up.
JERRY: There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.
JERRY: Is that so unforgivable? 
JERRY: Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? 
JERRY: yeah. I think I do.
JERRY: I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.
JERRY: But that's not what she thinks.
JERRY: All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? 
JERRY: Hello there you are.
JERRY: Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.
JERRY: Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me (flustered, he indicates a nose pick)
JERRY: But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
JERRY: But there - but there was no pick! 
JERRY: No! 
JERRY: An' what if I did do it? 
JERRY: The pick?
JERRY: I think I've seen that look.
JERRY: Boy, they really worked on your pectorals.
JERRY: You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 9:50, I'm not gonna be able to make it!
JERRY: And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!
JERRY: No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 10:30.
JERRY: [not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]
JERRY: What are <you> doing here?
JERRY: [to taxi driver] Take the Park!
JERRY: [rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your point!
JERRY: That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.
JERRY: I gotta get out of this cab...
JERRY: No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! 
JERRY: Your trench coat in my closet?
JERRY: No thanks, maybe some other time.
JERRY: No, I don't.
JERRY: No. No. I was kidding. It's terrible.
JERRY: Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to 'em. Mind if I walk through real quick?
JERRY: 44th and 9th.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Gasoline? 
JERRY: Hey, did I make it?
JERRY: Oh, great. That's great. What a night.
JERRY: You got my spot?
JERRY: Really...
JERRY: Weight? 
JERRY: My whole night's ruined. I didn't do any sets, didn't do any movies...
JERRY: ``Rochelle Rochelle'', huh?
JERRY: [his interest piqued] Minsk?
JERRY: Elaine?
JERRY: Elaine!
JERRY: George?
JERRY: Hey, where's Kramer?
JERRY: Let's get outta here. [to Buckles] I'll see ya.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: I don't want the coat.
JERRY: I didn't even use the ticket!
JERRY: I only have a twenty.
JERRY: Hey, I've been back four days, I want my mail.
JERRY: Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail.
JERRY: Hey, how ya doin?
JERRY: (looking behind the counter) Hey, is that Babu? 
JERRY: Look at you, you got the job.
JERRY: Oh, I didn't do anything.
JERRY: Come on.
JERRY: Ok, great, well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu.
JERRY: Ok, I'll see you around the building.
JERRY: (returning to the table) Remember Babu Bhatt?
JERRY: Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? 
JERRY: Can you bring my mail then?
JERRY: Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.
JERRY: Monday, I think.
JERRY: Hey listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, why don't you have dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if you want, you know, have a little company, take the pressure off.
JERRY: ...he never heard of corduroy!
JERRY: He never heard of corduroy! 
JERRY: I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone.
JERRY: We'll be funny.
JERRY: No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's.
JERRY: No, it's too trendy, no Isabella's.
JERRY: Look who's here! 
JERRY: Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model.
JERRY: How did you know?
JERRY: That's so funny!
JERRY: Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: What's the matter?
JERRY: Why not?
JERRY: Biff?
JERRY: You're not worried about that?
JERRY: I mean, so what if I'm funny? 
JERRY: Well, should we leave?
JERRY: I don't have to be funny, I don't care.
JERRY: No way! 
JERRY: Of course I can, am I being funny now?
JERRY: Oh, this is funny? 
JERRY: George, is this funny?
JERRY: (subdued, almost somber) Hello. Welcome back.
JERRY: Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? 
JERRY: Well thank you very much, it's about time.
JERRY: Drop the case? 
JERRY: (leafing through his mail) Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.
JERRY: Hear that? 
JERRY: I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: What happened?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: What happened?
JERRY: Wow! 
JERRY: You plunked him.
JERRY: Wow, this is incredible!
JERRY: What's going on out there?
JERRY: Babu? 
JERRY: Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame.
JERRY: I will, Babu! 
JERRY: (thumbing through his mail) Uh oh.
JERRY: Well this is interesting.
JERRY: It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.
JERRY: If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened.
JERRY: Yeah, so am I being funny now?
JERRY: See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey George, look, I'm not funny now.
JERRY: Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired.
JERRY: Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.
JERRY: Ah, will you stop it already?
JERRY: How long is this gonna go on?
JERRY: Well, when is that gonna be?
JERRY: Consummation? 
JERRY: (somber) That's wonderful news. Thank you.
JERRY: Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful.
JERRY: I don't care.
JERRY: Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.
JERRY: I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've been so helpful.
JERRY: Yeah, I'll just pay for this.
JERRY: Babu!
JERRY: You remember Elaine.
JERRY: Oh, Babu.
JERRY: We do what we can.
JERRY: Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.
JERRY: Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full.
JERRY: Oh, I don't want to bother you.
JERRY: So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box.
JERRY: You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.
JERRY: Well not technically.
JERRY: Well what about her?
JERRY: Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! 
JERRY: The wheels are in motion, things are happening!
JERRY: I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care
JERRY: C'mon up.
JERRY: Babu must be back.
JERRY: Where's Babu?
JERRY: Who are you?
JERRY: I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.
JERRY: Hey, what happened? 
JERRY: No.
JERRY: He's in Pakistan.
JERRY: What do you mean, oh boy?
JERRY: Told her the truth? 
JERRY: That's because she had my mail.
JERRY: How could you go in there?
JERRY: Well, what happened?
JERRY: Yeah, it's funny!
JERRY: It cannot not be funny! 
JERRY: Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine.
JERRY: Right, right. Okay. (Writing) Elaine enters.
JERRY: (Thinks) What does she say...?
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.
JERRY: Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.)
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Who?
JERRY: Did you talk to her?
JERRY: So what happened?
JERRY: Yeah, I know about the three dates.
JERRY: What do you mean, you snubbed her?
JERRY: Yeah, I know.
JERRY: Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...
JERRY: Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.
JERRY: Something derogatory? 
JERRY: Well, Gail Cunningham.
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? 
JERRY: I took two bites, how am I finished? 
JERRY: I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.
JERRY: Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?
JERRY: Ah, the power lunch crowd.
JERRY: Would you care to join us?
JERRY: See ya.
JERRY: That bothered you?
JERRY: It did?
JERRY: I thought your mother's paying for it.
JERRY: You what?
JERRY: You kissed her?
JERRY: What kinda great friend are you? 
JERRY: And what did she do?
JERRY: I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?
JERRY: So what?
JERRY: Are you alright?
JERRY: Oh, Where did you eat?
JERRY: Ah. I know the chef there.
JERRY: Oh, you have a daughter?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?
JERRY: Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Another ending?
JERRY: Maybe we should go.
JERRY: I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Oh, I'm Jerry.
JERRY: We're here discussing our script with your father.
JERRY: Uh huh.
JERRY: What were you doing?
JERRY: You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.
JERRY: Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.
JERRY: That's why I poked.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: She did?
JERRY: Is that what she said? 
JERRY: She is?
JERRY: Hello? 
JERRY: (to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on? 
JERRY: There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...
JERRY: You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! 
JERRY: You know what we could do? 
JERRY: The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Ya.
JERRY: Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.
JERRY: Ok. (Kramer goes back to his apartment.)
JERRY: Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)
JERRY: Beautiful.
JERRY: No, come on! 
JERRY: I'll get you another one just like it!
JERRY: Hey! 
JERRY: Fancy meeting you here!
JERRY: You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.
JERRY: Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened.
JERRY: No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)
JERRY: Really good.
JERRY: Very tasty.
JERRY: The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?
JERRY: Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.
JERRY: It's funny!
JERRY: Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?
JERRY: If you can.
JERRY: I think what he's trying to say is, "get the bouilla-base." (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)
JERRY: Unbelievable! 
JERRY: The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.
JERRY: Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...
JERRY: Living or all time?
JERRY: Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.
JERRY: [indignantly] What's the matter with you?
JERRY: I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me: "C'mon Jerry, go along, go along..."
JERRY: Y'know I hear that all the time.
JERRY: That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.
JERRY: Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.
JERRY: Oh yeah, what? 
JERRY: You told me that already like two months ago.
JERRY: How you gonna get out of *that* one?
JERRY: He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?
JERRY: Yeah, I washed it.
JERRY: So *wash* *it*.
JERRY: I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...
JERRY: Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something?
JERRY: Actually, we met in the gym locker room.
JERRY: [quizzically] Live together?
JERRY: Know *what*?
JERRY: Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar!
JERRY: There's been a big misunderstanding here! 
JERRY: I mean that's fine if that's who you are...
JERRY: I mean I have many gay friends...
JERRY: It was a *joke*...
JERRY: No steam!
JERRY: Today's not my birthday.
JERRY: Look at this! 
JERRY: Hey, where you going?
JERRY: Thank you very much, that's great- >click< Oh! 
JERRY: Hey, how ya doin'? 
JERRY: She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. [sarcastically] I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... >click click< Sharon? 
JERRY: What are you talkin' about?
JERRY: You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?
JERRY: Well, maybe she was disconnected.
JERRY: Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. >click click click<...
JERRY: Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. >click click<
JERRY: Oh no! 
JERRY: Oh no! 
JERRY: No, no, of course not! 
JERRY: She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.
JERRY: So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that...
JERRY: "Guys And Dolls"? 
JERRY: "The Collected Works Of Bette Midler".
JERRY: What do you got there?
JERRY: "Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable..." Oh no! 
JERRY: Not that there's anything wrong with that...
JERRY: "Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old married couple--" *I told you that pear was washed*!
JERRY: Here we go...
JERRY: It's not true!
JERRY: So are you...
JERRY: Oh, my God! 
JERRY: Ma!
JERRY: Ma, it's not true!
JERRY: Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!
JERRY: Y'know, I think I'll pass on the "Guys And Dolls"...
JERRY: What?
JERRY: I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright*, I forgive you...
JERRY: I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.
JERRY: I know! 
JERRY: [forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell out of here!
JERRY: Tell her what?
JERRY: Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll *all* be over...
JERRY: Yeah, how about a mute?
JERRY: Ah, where you gonna meet a mute?
JERRY: A deep, yawning chasm...
JERRY: Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.
JERRY: Hey! 
JERRY: What're you gonna do down there?
JERRY: That's what I do with him [points at George]
JERRY: What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?
JERRY: Nah, it's not for me.
JERRY: I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.
JERRY: Thank you.
JERRY: Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your guy?
JERRY: *We*? 
JERRY: George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.
JERRY: What're you talkin' about?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Where do you *get* this?
JERRY: Hello, *Newman*...
JERRY: What records?
JERRY: Why *is* that?
JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
JERRY: Yeah, is this Sid Field's residence?
JERRY: Mr. Fields?
JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
JERRY: No, no, the--
JERRY: The woman, she--
JERRY: Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.
JERRY: No, Mr. Field, look, really I'm--
JERRY: What's all this stuff?
JERRY: You don't want any of this?
JERRY: You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.
JERRY: Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...
JERRY: Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.
JERRY: C'mon Elaine, it's just a goiter...
JERRY: They really should mention that in the breakdown: height, weight, goiter.
JERRY: Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.
JERRY: Whattya mean?
JERRY: Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.
JERRY: So quit!
JERRY: What happened?
JERRY: Oh yeah, you and your *Sergio Mendes*...
JERRY: Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away: Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman...
JERRY: Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah.
JERRY: But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal [and, ala Carson] Wild, Wild, Stuff...
JERRY: Well you said they could come and take the records.
JERRY: So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--
JERRY: Where's his teeth! 
JERRY: Well turn the light on...
JERRY: That's the garbage disposal!
JERRY: Yes, but--
JERRY: [Into intercom] Yes?
JERRY: Alright, c'mon up.
JERRY: [To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.
JERRY: Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--
JERRY: I, I'm sorry.
JERRY: Well, I brought them up there to take his records--
JERRY: There you are. Did you find him?
JERRY: Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.
JERRY: Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.
JERRY: Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right?
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Tremendous girl.
JERRY: Yeah. I really like her.
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: How do you know?
JERRY: I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)
JERRY: Yes, they do!
JERRY: A leg man? 
JERRY: Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.
JERRY: Well, I do.
JERRY: Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.
JERRY: Yes! 
JERRY: Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.
JERRY: Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.
JERRY: Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.
JERRY: No! 
JERRY: You're sure?
JERRY: Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.
JERRY: Just 'cause of that? 
JERRY: You don't touch the nose! 
JERRY: Well, I take it very seriously.
JERRY: Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.
JERRY: You? 
JERRY: Real busy now down at the office?
JERRY: You put her on a pedestal.
JERRY: He puts 'em on a dental chair.
JERRY: Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral?
JERRY: What, are you kidding? 
JERRY: Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.
JERRY: This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!
JERRY: You fell on her?
JERRY: You what?
JERRY: Wow.
JERRY: Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.
JERRY: So have I.
JERRY: Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
JERRY: Aw, what are you doin' to me? 
JERRY: I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!
JERRY: But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?
JERRY: Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.
JERRY: Hey. George off to Detroit?
JERRY: There's Sidra.
JERRY: Where?
JERRY: Talkin' to Sidra?
JERRY: I don't think that's Salman.
JERRY: If that's Rushdie, they're real.
JERRY: Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.
JERRY: Oh, how can you be so sure?
JERRY: Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!
JERRY: Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...
JERRY: I'm gonna find out tonight.
JERRY: Hey, would you mind switching seats?
JERRY: Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.
JERRY: How ya doin'?
JERRY: Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.
JERRY: Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger.
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: How do you like that.
JERRY: Aw, you know people.
JERRY: Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.
JERRY: Whatever you want me to tell them.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Oh, there's no emergency...
JERRY: Excuse me. (Gets up and answers the door.) Alright, what is it? 
JERRY: This is an emergency? 
JERRY: I don't know, my bathing suit? 
JERRY: Your boys should stay in their neighborhood.
JERRY: Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. (Kramer goes to get the suit. Elaine enters.)
JERRY: Oh, hi, Elaine.
JERRY: Oh. yeah. Alright. (pushes Kramer and Elaine out the door, then sits next to Sidra on the couch.) So, where were we?
JERRY: Right, you were leaving.
JERRY: That was an accident!
JERRY: You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. And you can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. Then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin'  Alright, gimme everything you have, too''.
JERRY: (flips a roll of paper towels in the air) Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.
JERRY: Tonight.
JERRY: I... don't... know...
JERRY: I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...
JERRY: Look at that. Why do I get bananas? 
JERRY: Yeah, I did that too.
JERRY: Sure.
JERRY: Wow!
JERRY: Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.
JERRY: Nobody you know...
JERRY: Why don't you put it in the *bank*?
JERRY: *Oh*, you mean you wanna *lose* it...
JERRY: Yes I did.
JERRY: Wood is good.
JERRY: So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right?
JERRY: O.K., soon as Elaine gets here.
JERRY: What, you rented "Home Alone"?
JERRY: I thought you saw that already...
JERRY: Oh, right... But you *hated* it!
JERRY: What for?
JERRY: All right.. Go ahead.
JERRY: Yeah?
JERRY: No. Come on up.
JERRY: What's wrong?
JERRY: You said "gloves"...
JERRY: (to Kramer) Hey (snaps fingers) get your stuff, let's get going.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Oh, the "triangle" guy.
JERRY: Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?
JERRY: Artsy?
JERRY: Oh. (unh - very quiet sigh)
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: What's wrong with him?
JERRY: All right we'll wait for you.
JERRY: Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.
JERRY: Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.
JERRY: All right (picks up his sports bag)
JERRY: Y'know a lot of people have asked that...
JERRY: Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend. (puts his arm around Elaine's shoulder, but she shrugs it off twice)
JERRY: That's terrible...
JERRY: You know I can't get this *damn thing* to sleep. (about the Yo-Yo)
JERRY: Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?
JERRY: No, I believe it's next week.
JERRY: No I'm not...
JERRY: Hey Doc, check this out. [does an around-the-world with the Yo-Yo]
JERRY: I *just* learned that.  (proudly holding the Yo-Yo)
JERRY: I dunno...
JERRY: Yeah, that's true...
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.
JERRY: Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves, wanted to come home and start working on his floor.
JERRY: Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. (opens the fridge and gets a bottle of water.)
JERRY: Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to fancy restaurants. (takes a sip of water)
JERRY: You mean Florence Nightingale. **
JERRY: Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton. **
JERRY: I'm not sure, but I think she was nice. (takes a sip of water)
JERRY: Yeah, I think you would.
JERRY: No. Why don't you buy it? 
JERRY: I will.
JERRY: No, it isn't. I can find out.
JERRY: There are ways.
JERRY: Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe-- "Jerry Jerry Dingleberry", and-hu "Seinsmelled"...
JERRY: Yeah. a-hu. What about you? 
JERRY: Oh... *you*...
JERRY: No.
JERRY: "Hest"? 
JERRY: I know, I should've asked her.
JERRY: I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.
JERRY: No...
JERRY: Alright, that's enough. (sips coffee)
JERRY: How am I gonna do that?
JERRY: You asked a date to go to the operation?
JERRY: Mulva? 
JERRY: Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll watch 'em go slice this fat bastard up. (sips coffee)
JERRY: What are you eating?
JERRY: No...
JERRY: Where'd you get those?
JERRY: No.
JERRY: I don't want one.
JERRY: I don't want any!
JERRY: No! 
JERRY: (pointing at the operation he mouths the words) Did it go in?
JERRY: ...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the patient!
JERRY: Into the patient, *literally*!
JERRY: Yes, the hole!
JERRY: No!
JERRY: Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.
JERRY: They sealed him up with the mint inside.
JERRY: Yes!
JERRY: Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Come on up.
JERRY: Why did you force that mint on me? 
JERRY: That's true.
JERRY: Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...
JERRY: We gotta confess.
JERRY: Yes!
JERRY: I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! 
JERRY: I'm telling and you can't stop me!
JERRY: Oh yeah, that's the spot...
JERRY: Oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh that's terrific... Mulva.
JERRY: Mulva?
JERRY: Oh my eh, my Aunt's name is Mulva. She's-she's a masseuse.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Oh, good idea...
JERRY: Oh, I was just looking for er, some... gum or... mint.
JERRY: No! 
JERRY: [whispering] No, no news. You better get out of here.
JERRY: Oh No, wait a second... Wait a second... I-I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name.
JERRY: O.K. (closes the apartment door)
JERRY: Oh, okay.
JERRY: Oh, Hey, there's a name you don't forget.
JERRY: Bye.
JERRY: No, I haven't heard anything.
JERRY: Really...
JERRY: Yeah, I'm sure...
JERRY: Well, I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: Look, I gotta try and help the guy.
JERRY: Yes I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition...
JERRY: Oh, that's *fantastic*!
JERRY: Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!
JERRY: That's nice.
JERRY: What do you mean?
JERRY: I don't think so...
JERRY: I believe we're not...
JERRY: Well, I'll think about it...
JERRY: Really...
JERRY: Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph?
JERRY: Do you have it with you?
JERRY: Ah, Le'me see.  (hands Jerry the playbill)
JERRY: Yeah, I-I know...
JERRY: Yes I do.
JERRY: It-it rhymes with a female body part.
JERRY: Mulva...
JERRY: Aub, ah, Gipple?
JERRY: Loleola?
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''.  And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. "Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''.
JERRY: ...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? 
JERRY: Is that bothering you?
JERRY: [mockingly] "Please hurry". Look at you. Look at what you've become.
JERRY: Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?
JERRY: He'll like you more...
JERRY: Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...
JERRY: So, where am I dropping you?
JERRY: This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...
JERRY: So, is tonight "the night"?
JERRY: Oooh! 
JERRY: Boy, do you smell something?
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.
JERRY: But the whole car smells.
JERRY: So when somebody has B.O., the "O" usually stays with the "B". Once the "B" leaves, the "O" goes with it.
JERRY: So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night...
JERRY: What about skunk?
JERRY: Horse manure?
JERRY: Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it.
JERRY: It means he's lying.
JERRY: Why? 
JERRY: No. Never.
JERRY: Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex.
JERRY: Anything's *possible*...
JERRY: What's the matter with you?
JERRY: Oh yeah, Steinbrenner...
JERRY: I know the list...
JERRY: What smell?
JERRY: Whatd'ya mean I stink?
JERRY: I showered! 
JERRY: Don't you see what's happening here? 
JERRY: What happened? 
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it.
JERRY: No, no. It's the valet guy.
JERRY: Oh... No, that's ridiculous.
JERRY: Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism.
JERRY: There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a "Smell Gestapo". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush...
JERRY: Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...
JERRY: Here he is... that's the guy! 
JERRY: I mean the car *stinks*! 
JERRY: Stinks!
JERRY: Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!
JERRY: That's from the car!
JERRY: Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse.
JERRY: You've gotta smell the car
JERRY: C'mon! 
JERRY: Alright, will you pay for the cleaning?
JERRY: Let's do it.
JERRY: Wait a minute! 
JERRY: It still smells!
JERRY: I don't know!
JERRY: I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!
JERRY: You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.
JERRY: Are you crazy? 
JERRY: You see! 
JERRY: Susan!
JERRY: What is going on?
JERRY: That's the *least* of what you've accomplished...
JERRY: '90.
JERRY: That's strange...
JERRY: 23 000.
JERRY: Wait a second... My jacket! 
JERRY: This... **thing**... has got to be stopped!
JERRY: I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! 
JERRY: Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.
JERRY: You don't like the Drake?
JERRY: How could you not like the Drake?
JERRY: The Drake is good!
JERRY: Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!
JERRY: Easy?
JERRY: Do you like the Drake?
JERRY: It's Isosceles
JERRY: The chip-in!
JERRY: Yeah!
JERRY: What about your father's car?
JERRY: Are you serious?
JERRY: How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!
JERRY: Good to meet you!
JERRY: We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.
JERRY: Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.
JERRY: Yes, they do!
JERRY: Well there's spaces there, they must drive!
JERRY: Do you believe the deal we got on this? 
JERRY: No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! 
JERRY: Hey, what's going on over here?
JERRY: (to a woman) Hey, what's going on?
JERRY: Is she OK?
JERRY: Son's of bitches! 
JERRY: I don't know...
JERRY: I love the Drake!
JERRY: Let's get out of here.
JERRY: The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?
JERRY: What are we, John Dillinger? 
JERRY: I got it! 
JERRY: Yeah! 
JERRY: Not if they don't know you...
JERRY: What if we created some sort of diversion? 
JERRY: That doesn't work, we'll give 'em Kramer!
JERRY: (as George picks up a broken piece of his car) You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out...
JERRY: (to the Drake) So it was a good party, huh? 
JERRY: (to the Drake) Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. (To Elaine) Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?
JERRY: (to the Drake) Sure! 
JERRY: The Drake is great!
JERRY: Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.
JERRY: Yes?
JERRY: Come on up.
JERRY: St. Elizabeth's Hospital? 
JERRY: Wow, what happened?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.
JERRY: I am gonna make good use of this! 
JERRY: So where're we eatin'?
JERRY: When did this happen?
JERRY: (looking at the TV) Look at the picture on this thing...
JERRY: They know how to make 'em...
JERRY: Well... we should...
JERRY: Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.
JERRY: He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.
JERRY: I know it is!
JERRY: I hate the Drake! 
JERRY: Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.
JERRY: Hey, guess what? 
JERRY: I don't know about defraying.
JERRY: We're not gettin' that TV.
JERRY: You are.
JERRY: Because that's your thing!
JERRY: Yeah, that's your thing.
JERRY: (to George) You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Your father got arrested? 
JERRY: Ho-ly!
JERRY: So what are you gonna do?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: What's the matter?
JERRY: What's over?
JERRY: She dumped you?
JERRY: Drop dead?
JERRY: She's pretty rough!
JERRY: 240 bucks?
JERRY: Used?
JERRY: That's their policy.
JERRY: You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? 
JERRY: Let's go out and celebrate! 
JERRY: Come on let's eat something. (phone rings)
JERRY: (to the phone) Hello?
JERRY: Oh, hi Rita.
JERRY: Oh, my God. Did he get fired?
JERRY: Russell's disappeared?
JERRY: You're passing already? 
JERRY: Yeah, see ya. (he hangs up)
JERRY: Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?
JERRY: No one knows.
JERRY: Hey look at this. What is going on here?
JERRY: What a family!
JERRY: What?
JERRY: So, what's her name?
JERRY: Is she nice?
JERRY: So you like her?
JERRY: You don't know?
JERRY: Well do you feel anything?
JERRY: All right, let me ask you this: when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?
JERRY: You're just straightening up or you're cleaning?
JERRY: You do the tub?
JERRY: On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?
JERRY: Okay, I think you're in love!
JERRY: Tub is love.
JERRY: So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.
JERRY: Sexual?
JERRY: Below the equator?
JERRY: Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.
JERRY: You got the tap?
JERRY: The tap is tough.
JERRY: Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
JERRY: It's a very complicated area.
JERRY: It's a haaazy mystery.
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: And the guy never knows?
JERRY: How can he not know that?
JERRY: I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Are you saying...
JERRY: With me?
JERRY: You faked with me?
JERRY: You faked with me?
JERRY: No.
JERRY: You faked it?
JERRY: That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
JERRY: What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?
JERRY: I'm stunned, I'm shocked! 
JERRY: But I'm so good.
JERRY: She faked.
JERRY: Maybe they've all been faking.
JERRY: No no, it was no joke.
JERRY: No. None.
JERRY: (raising hand) Faked 'em all.
JERRY: The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.
JERRY: How did she do it? 
JERRY: What could you have done?
JERRY: I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
JERRY: Don't aaaaah! 
JERRY: Hello... Oh hello Elaine.
JERRY: I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.
JERRY: What, the grilled cheese? 
JERRY: Oooh that. Well...
JERRY: Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: Bye.
JERRY: I really don't feel like seeing her.
JERRY: You faked it? 
JERRY: Yeah, but why would you... (Kramer is eating a peach then disgusted he spits it out) Bad peach?
JERRY: Did you get that at Joe's?
JERRY: That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.
JERRY: You're returning used fruit?
JERRY: Satisfied?
JERRY: Meryl Streep?
JERRY: Ah, she's okay.
JERRY: Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?
JERRY: Nothing.
JERRY: Nooo.
JERRY: Give me another shot!
JERRY: Another shot, I want another shot.
JERRY: Yes!
JERRY: Come on! 
JERRY: Oh friendship... friendship, shmanship .
JERRY: We won't ruin the friendship.
JERRY: Elaine...
JERRY: A half hour, give me a half our.
JERRY: Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!
JERRY: You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?
JERRY: That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.
JERRY: Come on, Elaine!
JERRY: Well good night.
JERRY: Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.
JERRY: Oh what, you're upset?
JERRY: No I can't, maybe you're faking.
JERRY: I'm sorry too.
JERRY: You're a baby!
JERRY: They're mysterious little fellows aren't they?
JERRY: You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! 
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Why can't you get it?
JERRY: What happened?
JERRY: (to George) No. (to Kramer) I told you not to say anything.
JERRY: Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
JERRY: Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?
JERRY: Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. 
JERRY: Patty Lawrence had 'em!
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Hello Elaine? 
JERRY: Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?
JERRY: All this? 
JERRY: Avocado? 
JERRY: How soft?
JERRY: (looking over the list) Hmm ah. I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? 
JERRY: Uh huh. Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? 
JERRY: Plantains?
JERRY: What the hell is a plantain.
JERRY: (grabbing the list from Kramer) You're not getting any plantains.
JERRY: Hey Joe.
JERRY: Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Uh, gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. Alright let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... (looks at Joe; Joe gives him a weird look)ooo, just right... and three plantains uh ought to do it.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: (shocked) Wha, what are you talking about?
JERRY: I can't buy mangos and plantains?
JERRY: You're making a big mistake, Joe!
JERRY: Are saying you're banning me from the store?
JERRY: Put it over there.
JERRY: What are you doing?
JERRY: You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.
JERRY: Sorry, I don't have any cash.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. (Elaine smiles and rolls her eyes at him) What brings you here?
JERRY: Oh and I've got some things of yours here.
JERRY: Well I'll get them.
JERRY: All right. (goes into his hallway and comes back) You got my fins?
JERRY: I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?
JERRY: They're next to the poker chips.
JERRY: I guess.
JERRY: Yeah, see you.
JERRY: (shocked) What?
JERRY: Are you serious?
JERRY: Sex... to save the friendship. (Elaine drops her bag, takes off her jacket and walks into Jerry's bedroom) Well, if we have to (un-tucks his shirt) we have to.
JERRY: It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff: orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!
JERRY: Oh, it won't be for that long.
JERRY: Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.
JERRY: My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!
JERRY: My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.
JERRY: A smirk?
JERRY: I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.
JERRY: (Stopping the notion) What's that?
JERRY: (quietly) Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
JERRY: Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..
JERRY: No, no. It-It's really funny. There's these two guys-
JERRY: (setting down a box) No thanks.
JERRY: I really don't eat it.
JERRY: I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..
JERRY: Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door)
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.
JERRY: Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! 
JERRY: Yeah, take it easy. (Leaves)
JERRY: Right.
JERRY: Well..
JERRY: Excuse me?
JERRY: Yeah.. yeah.
JERRY: Puffy.
JERRY: Yeah, that's right!
JERRY: (Points at Elaine) And the indigent.
JERRY: Sure.
JERRY: Uh-huh.
JERRY: Yep..
JERRY: (Shrugs) I - I don't get it.
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: They're hands!
JERRY: (Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my hands? 
JERRY: Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.
JERRY: It's just like in the movies.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: (Explaining) George has become a hand model.
JERRY: Yes.
JERRY: Oven mitts?
JERRY: Alright. (Jerry opens the door for George)
JERRY: Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up) Since I said what?
JERRY: What are you talking about?
JERRY: (Goes up to it) This?
JERRY: But, when did I do that?
JERRY: I don't know! 
JERRY: Where I go? 
JERRY: But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!
JERRY: I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! 
JERRY: They're making these?
JERRY: (Like a little kid) But, I don't want to be a pirate!
JERRY: When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.
JERRY: (Yelling out) Of course not! 
JERRY: (Arms out, complaining) I have to wear it! 
JERRY: (Mumbling out) Thank you, Bryant.
JERRY: (Looking down at the shirt; mumbling) Oh, thank you.
JERRY: Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.
JERRY: (Nervous laughter) Yeah.. like a pirate.. (Attempting to get on another subject) Anyway, ah, you know, we're hoping to, um, raise enough money.. with this.. uh..
JERRY: Uh-huh, yeah. (Smiling, nodding, clearly wanting Bryant to shut up)
JERRY: (Losing it, mad) Look, it's not my shirt.
JERRY: What's the difference? 
JERRY: (Pointing off screen, nodding) THAT I heard.
JERRY: Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you.
JERRY: (Reasoning) You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place!
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: (Pointing out) It didn't do me any good either! 
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: What happened with all the shirts?
JERRY: (While digging in his pocket for some money, he looks over the shirts one last time) You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt..
JERRY: No. You?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: You got me the air conditioner?
JERRY: Beautiful!
JERRY: Is it a good one?
JERRY: Commando 8?
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth? 
JERRY: He was running from a bee. (Elaine laughs)
JERRY: There's a lot of change down there.
JERRY: We're behind you, Aquaboy. Godspeed!
JERRY: Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.
JERRY: (bored) Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it.
JERRY: (While looking at posters of women wearing glasses) I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.
JERRY: Are you okay? 
JERRY: Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.
JERRY: (To George:) Hey, any luck? 
JERRY: All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.
JERRY: What's the matter?
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. (And to George:) What do you mean you can't tell me?
JERRY: I'm asking!
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, take care of it. (Jerry throws her some toilet paper) Come on, George, what is it?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Amy and Jeffrey?
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.
JERRY: We're gonna have to talk about this later. (Elaine holds the door open for Jerry while holding her leg) Thank you. Taxi!
JERRY: Why not? 
JERRY: But he was squinting.
JERRY: Are you kidding? 
JERRY: Nah, look at this. Cable's out.
JERRY: No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing. (Jerry picks up the phone and dials the number) I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?
JERRY: Yeah, you remember yesterday? 
JERRY: (laughing) Oh you must have done something.
JERRY: Didn't go out of the house? 
JERRY: Well, your day's getting more interesting already. (Jerry shows the phone) Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.
JERRY: No you can't. (hangs up the phone) Now let's cut the ball, sister! 
JERRY: Look, my friend saw you.
JERRY: You tell me.
JERRY: There isn't?
JERRY: Oh... all right... wanna get some pizza?
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: No, no, there's no side!
JERRY: No, no, no ugly side.
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?
JERRY: It's coming! 
JERRY: I was an idiot for listening to you!
JERRY: Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.
JERRY: A bad side, an ugly side.
JERRY: So what? 
JERRY: Ah, he'd just deny it.
JERRY: Amy said nothing happened.
JERRY: Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!
JERRY: They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.
JERRY: (Stunned:) No, keep it. (Elaine enters the apartment) Hey what happened to you? 
JERRY: A little white dog?
JERRY: Snowball? 
JERRY: He's like a squirrel.
JERRY: You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.
JERRY: Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!
JERRY: I don't know what to believe! 
JERRY: Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.
JERRY: I don't know what to tell you, Elton.
JERRY: (To George:) Who picked these out?
JERRY: They're ladies' glasses! 
JERRY: Hey, hey.
JERRY: Take it to the window.
JERRY: Just in time for Amy.
JERRY: Rabies.
JERRY: Hey, hey, what is this? 
JERRY: Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel.
JERRY: He does look like a horse.
JERRY: Hey, shall we spit on him?
JERRY: Oh, you'll find out.
JERRY: Well, I'm very mysterious by nature. (Jerry knocks on the door) A lot of women find that attractive.
JERRY: Oh?
JERRY: This is Amy.
JERRY: Unlce Leo, what are you doing here?
JERRY: Ooh! 
JERRY: Oh really?
JERRY: Uncle Leo! 
JERRY: Thank you.
JERRY: To the Paul Simon concert in the park!
JERRY: That's right, lady!
JERRY: I thought you'd like that.
JERRY: Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason.
JERRY: Thank you.
JERRY: (To Amy:) Aha! 
JERRY: Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.
JERRY: Oh... oh... wanna get some pizza?
JERRY: I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.
JERRY: So, does he like you?
JERRY: You like him?
JERRY: So, how did you meet him?
JERRY: So, he's a writer.
JERRY: Yeah, big surprise.
JERRY: So, what did you do?
JERRY: Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on.
JERRY: Oh, what do you think? 
JERRY: (taps on the window) Hey...
JERRY: That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant.
JERRY: Hey Barry, how you doing?
JERRY: This is my friend George.
JERRY: Yeah, so how's my money?
JERRY: What, you got a cold?
JERRY: Bathroom uh, bathroom's uh right over there.
JERRY: Did you see that?
JERRY: What was all that sniffing?
JERRY: You don't think...?
JERRY: I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy could write checks to himself right out of my account.
JERRY: Then, what was all that sniffing?
JERRY: Today's not cold.
JERRY: Sniffing, with his nose.
JERRY: No, I asked him.
JERRY: I don't know, you know, what if...?
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: All I know he was sniffing.
JERRY: I know.
JERRY: Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.
JERRY: No, he didn't use 'man'.
JERRY: No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.
JERRY: Do you think that's a bad sign?
JERRY: I don't know. (takes off his sweater) This sweater really itches me. You want it?
JERRY: You're out of your mind you know that.
JERRY: It's an exclamation point! 
JERRY: A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.
JERRY: George was right. Didn't take you long.
JERRY: Good idea. (Jerry calls Barry's office)
JERRY: Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.
JERRY: Out of town?
JERRY: South America?
JERRY: I'll call back, thank you. (hangs up the phone) He went to South America!
JERRY: Who goes to South America?
JERRY: Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine.
JERRY: Yes, I'm impugning a continent.
JERRY: Hello Newman.
JERRY: Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out...
JERRY: All right, shut up the both of you! 
JERRY: Yeah maybe you should.
JERRY: All right, what are you gonna say to him?
JERRY: No, you stay here in the car.
JERRY: All right Newman, one more peep outta you, you're out of the whole operation!
JERRY: There he is. He's going into that bar.
JERRY: Be careful Kramer.
JERRY: No, you stay here in the car. I may need you.
JERRY: I might need you to get me a soda.
JERRY: You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.
JERRY: You should try this.
JERRY: Not even once?
JERRY: You're an idiot.
JERRY: Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot.
JERRY: What do you mean you don't like it? 
JERRY: 'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.'
JERRY: 'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'.
JERRY: Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.
JERRY: Yeah, thanks.
JERRY: You know this...
JERRY: Hi Ralph.
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Mohair, I think.
JERRY: You mean you just started sniffing?
JERRY: I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.
JERRY: Oh no! 
JERRY: Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
JERRY: It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.
JERRY: Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!
JERRY: What about the money? 
JERRY: Think so?
JERRY: Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?
JERRY: (interrupting) Thanks, that's enough.
JERRY: (Looking away) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, I looked. I saw.
JERRY: No, Uncomfortable? 
JERRY: So how long do they do this?
JERRY: No break?
JERRY: So after the sucking, comes the weaning.
JERRY: Well, you gotta wean.
JERRY: Yeah, I saw the spot.
JERRY: George...
JERRY: (to Elaine) Where's Kramer? 
JERRY: Ya, 1397.
JERRY: Will you shut up George.
JERRY: You were saying Stan? 
JERRY: Me? 
JERRY: (a la "Don Corleone") Never go against the family, Elaine.
JERRY: The bris?
JERRY: Well, maybe we should.
JERRY: Maybe they're admiring your spot.
JERRY: A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision.
JERRY: Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that?
JERRY: You mean that wasn't uh.
JERRY: No.. you?
JERRY: What'd you think?
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Ah, you're screwed.
JERRY: How about our little Elaine huh? 
JERRY: What's the matter?
JERRY: What now?
JERRY: (Kramer shows Jerry and Elaine the paper) "Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research".." Government funds genetic research at area hospital" ... Yeah, so?
JERRY: Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!
JERRY: Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. "Oo that little tail really turns me on."
JERRY: Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you?
JERRY: (TO GEORGE) Hey George, you ever see one?
JERRY: So what'd you think?
JERRY: Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man.
JERRY: Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. (holds his nose up like a pig) You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.
JERRY: Well, if I hear an anguished "oink", I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look (HE POINTS AT PASSERBY) Human, human, human... (HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR, WITH ALARM.) (WITH MOCK ALARM) Wait a second! 
JERRY: Oh, it's George.
JERRY: Alright Kramer, enough of this. Let's go find George.
JERRY: Kramer.
JERRY: Where's the Mohel?
JERRY: He's late already.
JERRY: I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship?
JERRY: Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.
JERRY: Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.
JERRY: Hello.
JERRY: (uncertain) Yeah. I'm holding the baby.
JERRY: I'm going.
JERRY: I'm going.
JERRY: Don't push me.
JERRY: Hurry up George! 
JERRY: That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! 
JERRY: Flinched? 
JERRY: Who's got a tissues? 
JERRY: Oh the baby's fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt.
JERRY: A few stitches? 
JERRY: That was a one in a million Mohel.
JERRY: Look at this.
JERRY: Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! 
JERRY: Oh who made you a Mohel? 
JERRY: Nice Mohel picking, Elaine. You picked a helluva Mohel!
JERRY: Oh don't threaten me, Butcher Boy.
JERRY: Ya what was this? 
JERRY: It was not!
JERRY: (struggling to open a bottle with his bandaged finger) I can't do it. (A LA GODFATHER) Look what they did to my boy, They massacred my boy.
JERRY: (walking over the the buzzer to answer it) Oh, that's the Flicks.
JERRY: Myra, Stan.
JERRY: What's the matter?
JERRY: Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? 
JERRY: Are these seats unbelievable or what? 
JERRY: Here. 
JERRY: What, are you on Mercury? 
JERRY: You got a problem with paba? 
JERRY: You don't even know what paba is. 
JERRY: I'll go if someone else drives. You going? 
JERRY: You're bringing a date to a party? 
JERRY: A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions) Ho, ho, ho. 
JERRY: Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy. 
JERRY: That woman is absolutely stunning. 
JERRY: Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen. 
JERRY: B.L.? 
JERRY: I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing. 
JERRY: I gotta talk to her. What do you think? 
JERRY: I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals. 
JERRY: I have to. I won't be able to live with myself. 
JERRY: I can't. 
JERRY: I don't know, "Hi". 
JERRY: Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? 
JERRY: I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf. 
JERRY: Can't hear a thing. 
JERRY: Yeah, isn't that something? 
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match. 
JERRY: Wow good plan. 
JERRY: That's nice. 
JERRY: (turning to Kramer) That's nice for the freaks. 
JERRY: Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency. 
JERRY: Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men. 
JERRY: All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier. (Elaine drinks straight out of the orange juice container) Hey.
JERRY: But I thought things were going great. 
JERRY: Did she say why? 
JERRY: But that's your routine. 
JERRY: So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? 
JERRY: Hello... Oh hi dad... 
JERRY: Yeah. 
JERRY: He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV. 
JERRY: Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? 
JERRY: I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life. 
JERRY: Really. 
JERRY: Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night. 
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: Okay. 
JERRY: Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman. 
JERRY: Why? 
JERRY: Oh, uh, do you want to come with us? 
JERRY: Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this uh considered signing? 
JERRY: Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign. 
JERRY: She reads lips. 
JERRY: (Puts his hand over his mouth) What? 
JERRY: (Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas. 
JERRY: (Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm not sure about this. 
JERRY: (Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right. 
JERRY: Uh Laura, George was wondering if... 
JERRY: So I really had a good time. 
JERRY: So you want to go to the party on Friday night? 
JERRY: All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? 
JERRY: See I was saying "six" but she thought I was saying "sex". We straightened the whole thing out though. 
JERRY: Yeah. 
JERRY: Well "six" and "sex" are close. 
JERRY: Eh. 
JERRY: Well I'm not dating any other deaf women. 
JERRY: You're kidding. 
JERRY: In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there. 
JERRY: I know. It's like X-ray vision. 
JERRY: Can't do it Newman. 
JERRY: It's not going to happen. 
JERRY: Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign. 
JERRY: I said pull over by the stop sign. 
JERRY: ca. 
JERRY: You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night. 
JERRY: I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man. 
JERRY: Hey Todd.
JERRY: Hi tide? 
JERRY: No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody. 
JERRY: I know and on the first tournament of her comeback. 
JERRY: Thus ends the great ball man experiment. 
JERRY: I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You know (does the motion for the check) Check, Check. Unless the waiter isn't too shape then you gotta total it up. 
JERRY: I told ya. How good is this?
JERRY: How good?
JERRY: I know it.
JERRY: Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and put it in.
JERRY: Huh? 
JERRY: Suave! 
JERRY: You know, Kramer's gonna clean up on this place.
JERRY: He invested in it.
JERRY: Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so fuck(bleeped)ing good.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sorry.
JERRY: Who is it?
JERRY: Oh, oh.?
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: He's gone, George.
JERRY: Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune.
JERRY: They're doing an incredible business.
JERRY: How did you know?
JERRY: (answering the buzzer) Yeah?
JERRY: Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed like ten new minutes.
JERRY: (pulling out a tape from his pocket) Vvvvup. Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? 
JERRY: I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.
JERRY: What's the matter?
JERRY: Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a person could still make a mistake like that.
JERRY: Kramer!
JERRY: Me?
JERRY: No.
JERRY: I've gained eight.
JERRY: How did I gain eight?
JERRY: Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt.
JERRY: Well, how else could this have happened?
JERRY: What about me?
JERRY: Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat.
JERRY: There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing.
JERRY: Well, let's start the insanity.
JERRY: And they said they can do it?
JERRY: All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a specimen.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Gee, I'm really sorry.
JERRY: I'd be happy to.
JERRY: Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's uh yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it?
JERRY: Hello, Newman.
JERRY: It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.
JERRY: How's it doing?
JERRY: So what.
JERRY: Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
JERRY: You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back.
JERRY: What do you got there?
JERRY: Oh.
JERRY: You can't take that chemist out.
JERRY: Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.
JERRY: Well, I think the whole thing stinks.
JERRY: That's enough.
JERRY: With the smelling.
JERRY: Uh-huh.
JERRY: Well, so, what are you going to do? 
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: No, I believe he can.
JERRY: Hi!
JERRY: Listen, Matthew, I-I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do.
JERRY: That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up. (phone rings) Excuse me one second.
JERRY: (quickly moves over toward Matthew) What the *beep*(fuck) are you doing? 
JERRY: (surprised) He said that?
JERRY: No, but I expect to hear anytime.
JERRY: Why do you say that?
JERRY: Name tags?
JERRY: Oh, I see. So you can go, "Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? 
JERRY: (on the phone) Hello? 
JERRY: Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, (looking at the TV) Kramer, turn that up.
JERRY: Non-fat yogurt? 
JERRY: Well, we've got to do something. (grabs his phone) I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.
JERRY: The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.
JERRY: I can't eat this.
JERRY: It had fat in it, it's not good for you.
JERRY: So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.
JERRY: If there's a serial killer lose in your neighborhood, it seems like the safest thing is to be the neighbor. They never kill the neighbor. The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right? 
JERRY: No eight years isn't such a long streak. 
JERRY: No I haven't vomited in thirteen years. 
JERRY: Not since June 29, 1980. 
JERRY: Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George: "Can you believe it? 
JERRY: No Elaine he's normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York. 
JERRY: But you like your Joel Rifkin. 
JERRY: Ask him to change it. 
JERRY: Why not? 
JERRY: If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld. 
JERRY: Yeah. Eighteen strangles. 
JERRY: Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen? 
JERRY: Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him) 
JERRY: Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight. 
JERRY: George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality. 
JERRY: He feels he's funnier, more relaxed. 
JERRY: Jody the masseuse. 
JERRY: No! 
JERRY: Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex. 
JERRY: So it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato. 
JERRY: (to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here. 
JERRY: (touching the back of his neck) It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here. 
JERRY: Yeah. Let's go. 
JERRY: Yeah. Good seeing you again Karen. 
JERRY: I strained my neck last night. 
JERRY: I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work. 
JERRY: No deal. Why? 
JERRY: Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality. 
JERRY: Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand and put it on his shoulder) 
JERRY: Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV) 
JERRY: Yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder) 
JERRY: Yeah, he's a bad seed. 
JERRY: What are you doing? 
JERRY: Yeah. (disappointed) 
JERRY: No. The sex was fabulous. 
JERRY: I want the massage! 
JERRY: I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it. 
JERRY: I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating. 
JERRY: Yeah. 
JERRY: Yeah. 
JERRY: She had a good time. 
JERRY: Pretty much. 
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee) 
JERRY: I was blowing on the coffee. 
JERRY: Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her. 
JERRY: No. 
JERRY: Yes. 
JERRY: Yes. 
JERRY: "I don't like him." 
JERRY: Not everybody likes everybody! 
JERRY: You were very nice! 
JERRY: It has nothing to do with her sister. 
JERRY: Oh no. That was the dry heaves. 
JERRY: Jodi. 
JERRY: What are you doing here? 
JERRY: Kramer! 
JERRY: I'll see you tonight. (he's opening his door apartment as Kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe) 
JERRY: Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage from her yet! 
JERRY: So you had a good time. 
JERRY: Enjoyed yourself. 
JERRY: All right now you listen and you listen good! 
JERRY: The massages are out! 
JERRY: Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one. 
JERRY: I'm sorry, Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen) 
JERRY: Don't you ever talk about her like that! 
JERRY: What's the matter with you? 
JERRY: You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for? 
JERRY: Oh please. 
JERRY: Well, did you get the ball? 
JERRY: Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game. 
JERRY: Why don't you get somebody else? 
JERRY: Well, that's it! 
JERRY: (whining like Kramer) Ask Newman. 
JERRY: Hi. 
JERRY: Ah, no problem. That's fine. 
JERRY: That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! 
JERRY: Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? 
JERRY: No, nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table) 
JERRY: Go? 
JERRY: Why, what's wrong? 
JERRY: No. Yes you can. (he hangs on) 
JERRY: Come on! 
JERRY: What do you mean, no? 
JERRY: Look, who are you kidding? 
JERRY: Fine. Go. 
JERRY: What for? 
JERRY: You need to talk? 
JERRY: George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me. 
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: I can see that. 
JERRY: Don't worry. (she leaves) 
JERRY: You're a lucky guy. 
JERRY: George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods) 
JERRY: The swedish are very big massagers. You know? 
JERRY: You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? 
JERRY: How would you describe the smell in this house? 
JERRY: Yeah, that's part of it. (sniffs) Kasha? 
JERRY: Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really. 
JERRY: You're not allowed to have people over? 
JERRY: (picks it up) I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table. 
JERRY: What's the big rush? 
JERRY: Who? 
JERRY: Eh, eh, ah. Winona's gonna be there? 
JERRY: (interested) Really? 
JERRY: Thanks, because I would really like... 
JERRY: Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again) 
JERRY: Just put a coffee table book over it. 
JERRY: There you go. That'll get you home in time. 
JERRY: I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you. 
JERRY: (handing her a magazine) Here, read this. 
JERRY: Hey, maybe I should get Elaine something. 
JERRY: Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me? 
JERRY: What about, what about this thing? 
JERRY: Yeah. You know, kind of a peace offering. Cute. 
JERRY: Alright, I'll take it. 
JERRY: Surprise! 
JERRY: Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something. 
JERRY: Hi. Hi Winona. Nice to see you again. 
JERRY: I don't need a reason to give gifts, it's my nature. I love to make people happy. 
JERRY: Are you ready? 
JERRY: (whips off bag to reveal Indian) Ta-da! 
JERRY: It's a cigar store Indian. (to Elaine) Read the card. 
JERRY: Read it out loud. 
JERRY: (takes the card from Elaine) We had a little fight this afternoon. (reading from card) Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe. 
JERRY: Hey-yah, ho-ah, hey-yah, ho-ah. 
JERRY: ...ho-ah. It's, it's, it's kitschy. 
JERRY: She is? 
JERRY: Uh, Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld. 
JERRY: Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up? 
JERRY: And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya? 
JERRY: You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... (he spots a mailman crouched emptying a box) Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here. 
JERRY: I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood. 
JERRY: I didn't know that... 
JERRY: I, I had no idea. 
JERRY: Yeah, did a good job. 
JERRY: You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is! 
JERRY: Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see her tonight. 
JERRY: Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another mistake. 
JERRY: Hello. 
JERRY: Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway. 
JERRY: Wa, it's two weeks old. 
JERRY: You collect TV Guide? 
JERRY: I'll see you later. 
JERRY: I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest. 
JERRY: Ah, don't worry. I made reser... (catches himself) 
JERRY: I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodations. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats. 
JERRY: Got 'em on the street, from a scal... (catches himself again) 
JERRY: A uh, one of those guys. 
JERRY: You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events. 
JERRY: Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide. 
JERRY: Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this? 
JERRY: Thanks. 
JERRY: So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you. 
JERRY: Yeah. You almost ruined his life's work. 
JERRY: Yeah. 
JERRY: What'ya do with the one you took? 
JERRY: I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table. 
JERRY: Where you going? 
JERRY: My Indian? 
JERRY: Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions. 
JERRY: Why? 
JERRY: Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father. 
JERRY: You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you... (catches himself) 
JERRY: A uh, a person that uh... 
JERRY: Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh... 
JERRY: ...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to. 
JERRY: I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term. 
JERRY: I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide. 
JERRY: Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to Elaine) 
JERRY: What's the matter? 
JERRY: It is a good idea, Elaine. 
JERRY: You want a gyro? 
JERRY: Elaine! 
JERRY: I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 
JERRY: You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But it’s really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesn’t it? 
JERRY: Then he asked you out? 
JERRY: On your heart? 
JERRY: Doctor? 
JERRY: Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school. 
JERRY: Oh hi. 
JERRY: Yes, I’ll be stopping. 
JERRY: See you later. (to Elaine) Well we can’t all be dating podiatrists. (Elaine laughs)
JERRY: How did you get in? 
JERRY: Looks like a swan. 
JERRY: She’s limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? 
JERRY: Oh, whatever.
JERRY: Mmm, succulent. 
JERRY: To Latvian Orthodox? 
JERRY: You know it’s not like changing toothpaste. 
JERRY: Yeah well King Edward didn’t live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza. 
JERRY: Oh yeah. 
JERRY: Oh I don’t know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing. 
JERRY: To wash my hands. They’re sticky from the orange. 
JERRY: Right there. 
JERRY: (thinking to himself; picks up a tube) "Fungicide". Fungus? 
JERRY: Fungicide. I mean what could she have? 
JERRY: Exactly
JERRY: I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home. 
JERRY: I didn’t open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little. 
JERRY: I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldn’t do that. 
JERRY: Why don’t you ask that doctor what it is? 
JERRY: But that’s what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. They’re knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus. 
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: That’s all there is to it. 
JERRY: And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza? 
JERRY: Oh a slinky.
JERRY: Why did she give you that? 
JERRY: What do you mean she liked you? 
JERRY: You picked up on a vibe, from a nun. 
JERRY: Yea alright. 
JERRY: Oh hi. 
JERRY: (weakly) A little better. (fake cough) 
JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: Bye.
JERRY: She’s subletting Carol’s place for a month. 
JERRY: Yeah but there’s a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet. 
JERRY: So I don’t know what she’s using it for. 
JERRY: I didn’t even think to look. 
JERRY: Yeah. 
JERRY: Yeah I’ve got this old bottle of cough medicine. 
JERRY: Hi
JERRY: Hi. Can I use your bathroom? 
JERRY: Fine all done, just looking for the soap. 
JERRY: No I don’t see it. 
JERRY: Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? 
JERRY: Hey, did you talk to the doctor? 
JERRY: All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the bottle of fungicide.) 
JERRY: Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again? 
JERRY: How could you say that? 
JERRY: I was merely speaking extemporaneously. 
JERRY: Me too. 
JERRY: Yes. He’s a doctor. (Elaine starts to leave. ) Wait a second. (Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in Elaine’s purse.) (to George) What are you doing? 
JERRY: (Reading words George wrote on his hand) "Matthew, Luke, Paul", what you’re cheating on your conversion chest? 
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Who? 
JERRY: How do you know? 
JERRY: Wow
JERRY: What is that stench? 
JERRY: Hey. What are you doing? 
JERRY: The Kavorka? 
JERRY: What is this thing around your neck? 
JERRY: You know you’re funcifying the whole building. 
JERRY: Kramer. (knock, knock, knock) Kramer. 
JERRY: Good. What’s the matter? 
JERRY: Bonkers? 
JERRY: Oh it’s your cat! 
JERRY: Ooh, nothing. 
JERRY: Elaine it’s her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back. 
JERRY: But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? 
JERRY: The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.
JERRY: (eating pop corn) hmm I love this artificial flavoring I like it better than butter I think it's more consistent 
JERRY: what? 
JERRY: who do you think she is? 
JERRY: I wonder where Elaine is sitting? 
JERRY: hey 
JERRY: what's the matter with yours? 
JERRY: It's not one of those 976 calls, is it? 
JERRY: why do you do that? 
JERRY: hey where were you last night? 
JERRY: oh with huh.. pretty boy.. Tony 
JERRY: hey hey (fooling around with his collar) 
JERRY: Tony, hey hey (continues fooling) 
JERRY: huh huh 
JERRY: no what? 
JERRY: oh.. whoa.. 
JERRY: well maybe she couldn't spare it 
JERRY: well, you know, sometimes a square is everything 
JERRY: Elaine, you cannot judge a person on a situation like that. I mean it's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert 
JERRY: it's battle conditions 
JERRY: oh.. Jane she uh.. she uh.. 
JERRY: yeah that should be real fun 
JERRY: yeah 
JERRY: (on the phone) hey Andre, get the hell off the phone! 
JERRY: Kramer's Andre, he's fooling around with these 976 numbers (Kramer walks out of the bedroom) hey I told you, I don't want you doing that on my phone 
JERRY: hey you know it's weird because that voice sounded a little familiar to me 
JERRY: no I gotta go downtown 
JERRY: yeah 
JERRY: oh uh nothing, she just.. choked on a jujube 
JERRY: I know, I just can't bring myself to do it meanwhile that freezer keeps getting smaller and smaller (she smiles) (Elaine looks at her watch) oh, don't wanna keep Tony waiting 
JERRY: hunky.. Tony.. hey hey hey (fools around with his collar again) 
JERRY: of course you would 
JERRY: Elaine 
JERRY: different for a man 
JERRY: we're expected to be superficial 
JERRY: Elaine, he's a.. he's a male bimbo, he's a mimbo 
JERRY: and that's why you're going out with him 
JERRY: you know, I think George has a non-sexual crush on him 
JERRY: I mean, every time I see him, it's Tony this, Tony that. George is like a school girl around him 
JERRY: yeah yeah what is it with you and Tony? 
JERRY: cool guy? 
JERRY: you're making sandwiches? 
JERRY: (to Kramer): who is it? 
JERRY: yeah, so? 
JERRY: did you say flinty? 
JERRY: oh look at that I got oil all over me. Can I have your napkin? 
JERRY: you napkin I'm dripping 
JERRY: I used it up 
JERRY: you know I'd like to hear about this job of yours 
JERRY: you're fine (goes to the bathroom) 
JERRY: just press it 
JERRY: (coming out from the bathroom) who was it? 
JERRY: oh..huh.. is she coming up? 
JERRY: oh.. uh.. you know your breath is a little garlicky you better take some gum. 
JERRY: Yeah have a couple of pieces, weak, weak gum yeah 
JERRY: have some more, take some for the road. 
JERRY: trust me.. nah it's good 
JERRY: yeah stinks, terrible 
JERRY: hi Elaine 
JERRY: this is Jane Elaine 
JERRY: Saturday night (she leaves) 
JERRY: I know it's a big problem.. she puts like four pieces in her mouth, it's ridiculous, I don't think we're gonna be able to get together on Saturday night 
JERRY: well it's too much, it's embarrassing 
JERRY: she's one of these people, always have to be different 
JERRY: well 
JERRY: well aside from that from that, how did he like the sandwiches? 
JERRY: I've been waiting a while for this. You know it's a shame Tony got all banged up, we're not gonna be able to get together on Saturday night 
JERRY: yeah, it's a damn shame, a damn shame! 
JERRY: yeah without a doubt, I'm down (Kramer enters) oh hey how're you doing? 
JERRY: wait, where are you going? 
JERRY: alright I changed my mind, uh yeah I don't think I'm not gonna go now 
JERRY: Ok.
JERRY:See ya. (Jane Leaves; after the door closes Kramer jumps in shock) what's with you? 
JERRY: who? 
JERRY: oh you think she's Erika, the phone sex woman 
JERRY: oh you're crazy 
JERRY: It's impossible 
JERRY: it can't be 
JERRY: alright that's enough 
JERRY: what? 
JERRY: oh you're afraid he might look like Zippy the pinhead 
JERRY: oh I though you didn't care about his looks 
JERRY: aha 
JERRY: oh I'm sorry I didn't get most of that.. isn't that Kramer over there? 
JERRY: hey Kramer 
JERRY: what's all set? 
JERRY: how's you get her to meet here? 
JERRY: oh my god 
JERRY: hello.. Erika 
JERRY: how can u say things like that over the phone? 
JERRY: selling sexual pleasure over the phone? 
JERRY: paper goods? 
JERRY: thanks
JERRY: Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? 
JERRY: I once got Happy New Yeared in March.
JERRY: It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?
JERRY: Scary cold.
JERRY: That. (pointing at George)
JERRY: When did you get that?
JERRY: You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?
JERRY: Look at this
JERRY: Yeah. (pointing at Elaine as he goes into the bedroom)
JERRY: The fabric of society is very complex George.
JERRY: I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table.
JERRY: You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.
JERRY: You are. I can't get that thing in my car. (referring to George)
JERRY: Where's the heat in this car? 
JERRY: You're pretty comfortable up there eh, Bubble boy?
JERRY: Jerry.
JERRY: Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie.
JERRY: I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?
JERRY: I'm looking forward to it.
JERRY: Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?
JERRY: Love that babka.
JERRY: So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.
JERRY: I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.
JERRY: It's a tad dainty.
JERRY: Oh, see that's not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people.
JERRY: Ah, no, forget it.
JERRY: Well we saw you come in.
JERRY: David!
JERRY: Oh so you still don't believe us.
JERRY: See you later.
JERRY: That's the last babka. They got the last babka.
JERRY: That was our babka.
JERRY: We had that babka.
JERRY: Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless.
JERRY: Carrot cake? 
JERRY: Black Forrest? 
JERRY: How about a Napoleon?
JERRY: That was our babka. We had that babka!
JERRY: Another babka?
JERRY: Well-well we got to get the cinnamon.
JERRY: I beg your pardon? 
JERRY: … and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!
JERRY: Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved.
JERRY: Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Oh, oh take it back. Let's get another one.
JERRY: No no come on really, get another one. It’ll take a second.
JERRY: Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.
JERRY: A little hair? 
JERRY: What if it's your hair?
JERRY: Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. (pretends to pull hair out)
JERRY: Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?
JERRY: No. That’s out of the question.
JERRY: Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
JERRY: I'd rather not talk about it.
JERRY: All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Well I started screaming, "There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina." Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running (In the background -- CLERK’S VOICE: 57) and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.
JERRY: My mother's.
JERRY: Oh, good.
JERRY: Oh, that's lovely.
JERRY: That’s what you want to see, yeah. . . . Yeah, you want to trade your hair for some phlegm.
JERRY: Yeah that’s a good deal -- you win the Pennant with that trade, hair for phlegm.
JERRY: Huh, wa?
JERRY: I don’t know, I don't feel so good.
JERRY: My stomach, I , think it was that cookie.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there.
JERRY: Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up.
JERRY: I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.
JERRY: Fourteen years down the drain. (points and walks off -- to the bathroom)
JERRY: As good as it gets.
JERRY: Oh, no thanks.
JERRY: Hey, what happened to your coat? 
JERRY: What for?
JERRY: George!
JERRY: See ya'.
JERRY: I love these nature shows, I’ll watch and kind of nature show, and it’s amazing how you can always relate, to whatever they’re talking about. You know like you’re watching the African Dung Beetle and you’re going “Boy, his life is a lot like mine.” And you always root for whichever animal is the star of the show that week -- like if it’s the antelope, and there’s a lion chasing the antelope you go, “Run antelope Run! 
JERRY: Elaine, see this T-shirt, six years I've had this T-shirt. It's my best one, I call him… Golden Boy.
JERRY: Golden Boy’s always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry. Here... touch Golden Boy!
JERRY: But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure.
JERRY: You wanna barrow Golden Boy!
JERRY: No, no… I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like the title and insisted that he change it to "War and Peace"!
JERRY: That's were they got it from!
JERRY: I'm not joking!
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Your mother reads your mail?
JERRY: What do you mean like post-cards an...?
JERRY: She doesn't open...?
JERRY: You've caught your mother opening envelopes!
JERRY: What did she say?
JERRY: Isn't that against the law?
JERRY: He can't handle the truth!
JERRY: No.
JERRY: It's a mammal.
JERRY: Yeah, got it from the bank.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: I do.
JERRY: I really wanna have fun.
JERRY: Yeah, let me just stop by the cash machine and I'll meet you over at the coffee shop.
JERRY: (he hits a few keys and looks over at her) Cash advance... yes (hits a key) … no (he looks over again) balance inquiry... no (he looks again) receipt.... no (he looks again) processing... processing... (He opens the box, pulls out his money and then looks at the woman and says) I won!
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Oh Diane.
JERRY: Good, good.
JERRY: Since college.
JERRY: Yeah pluggin' along.
JERRY: Well he's kind of modest.
JERRY: Sure.
JERRY: Marine biology.
JERRY: Yeah, pretty damn good one, too!
JERRY: Yeah... he’s specializing in whales. He's working on lowering the cholesterol level, in whales… all that blubber -- quite unhealthy. You know it’s the largest mammal on earth but as George says "they don't have to be."
JERRY: Something huh?
JERRY: She looked great.
JERRY: She asked about you.
JERRY: Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get in touch with you.
JERRY: I got no problem with that.
JERRY: Expect a call.
JERRY: Now, I should tell you… that, at this point, she's under the impression that you’re - a - ah…
JERRY: A marine biologist.
JERRY: Yes.
JERRY: I may have mentioned it.
JERRY: Yes I know that.
JERRY: Why, you don't think it's a good job?
JERRY: Oh it's a fascinating field!
JERRY: I did it for you.
JERRY: You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.
JERRY: Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing and…
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Well what happened?
JERRY: What, what, what's wrong with you?
JERRY: Hey come on, you're getting it all over the floor!
JERRY: (to the phone) Hello… yeah… yes it is… really… ah, ah… Could you hold on a second? 
JERRY: She’s waking down the street and it hit her in the head!
JERRY: Wow.
JERRY: Yeah…
JERRY: Well you have insurance...
JERRY: Unbelievable!
JERRY: What is with this thing.
JERRY: Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that.
JERRY: Let me have a look at this thing.
JERRY: Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.
JERRY: I would like to know what my name’s doin in this creep's organizer to begin with.
JERRY: Who do I know who would have even been in a limousine yesterday anyway. Uhh-O h-owow!
JERRY: Oh, there you are!
JERRY: So?
JERRY: So what do you have to say for yourself?
JERRY: Why should I have anything for say for myself?
JERRY: A-Ahahahahah. Who told you?
JERRY: Can I take a guess?
JERRY: Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?
JERRY: Because I know who has it.
JERRY: Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met!
JERRY: I don't have it!
JERRY: Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.
JERRY: How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?
JERRY: Well that's a start.
JERRY: You know what room Testikov's in?
JERRY: Well, you want your organizer back don't you?
JERRY: Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her!
JERRY: Well you're not Lois Lane.
JERRY: Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? 
JERRY: Oh, here she comes.
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Elaine, this is Corinne.
JERRY: All right lets go. We'll meet you back down here in ten minutes, hopefully with the money.
JERRY: Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- Zip, I'm gone. (makes a running motion with both arms and his right foot)
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: It was nice meeting you…
JERRY: … you’re a real pleasure. (Jerry is being sarcastic)
JERRY: Right in the head! 
JERRY: Mammal.
JERRY: Well the-the crowd must have gone wild!
JERRY: Wow! 
JERRY: All right lets go.
JERRY: Ahhh… got my laundry back.
JERRY: He didn't make it.
JERRY: Yea. (pulls at the t-shirt) This is Golden Boy's son… Baby Blue.
JERRY: Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination? 
JERRY: Yeah. are you full? 
JERRY: Ah, here we go... apple pie! 
JERRY: You're not gonna have any? 
JERRY: Do you not like apple pie? 
JERRY: Well, at least taste it. 
JERRY: You won't even taste it? 
JERRY: Come on, try it! 
JERRY: She wouldn't so much as taste it.
JERRY: No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey) 
JERRY: No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse. 
JERRY: The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city. 
JERRY: Yeah. 
JERRY: Tell me about it! 
JERRY: They could at least try it. 
JERRY: What's the harm? 
JERRY: (still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie. 
JERRY: Audrey. 
JERRY: You did? 
JERRY: Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman? 
JERRY: (to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? 
JERRY: Keep it. (implied: please) 
JERRY: (Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie. 
JERRY: And you waved it away. 
JERRY: Did you give her a reason? 
JERRY: You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head. 
JERRY: Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is. 
JERRY: I think you know my policy. 
JERRY: No he's going downtown to guard the suit. 
JERRY: I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here? 
JERRY: You've tasted them? 
JERRY: Oh I see they have apple pie. 
JERRY: You've had the apple pie? 
JERRY: Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind. 
JERRY: (like a frustrated child) Why can't I know? 
JERRY: Hello Poppie. 
JERRY: The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves) 
JERRY: Huh? 
JERRY: No, Nothing. 
JERRY: So she tought I did it to get back at her 
JERRY: I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene. 
JERRY: Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something. 
JERRY: You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught. 
JERRY: We haven't spoken. 
JERRY: Yeah, and Poppie's got problems... 
JERRY: Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested) 
JERRY: (very disinterested) Hum... ok, what else you got? 
JERRY: Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it? 
JERRY: Georgio! 
JERRY: Did you hear something? 
JERRY: Yeah. 
JERRY: So what? 
JERRY: So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise? 
JERRY: You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts. 
JERRY: Audrey? 
JERRY: Was it apple? 
JERRY: This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel! 
JERRY: Oh, I got to see this thing. 
JERRY: Boy, the resemblance is uncanny. 
JERRY: Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney, 
JERRY: The Charlie Macarthy hearings. 
JERRY: What are you doing? 
JERRY: Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this. 
JERRY: I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright, I'm dropping you off at work, right? 
JERRY: Poppie's 
JERRY: Hello. 
JERRY: So how was the pie? 
JERRY: The apple pie you had today at Monks 
JERRY: Pretty good, wasn'it? 
JERRY: Oh, about the... uh (Jerry pretend to wash his hands) 
JERRY: Well, Poppie's a little sloppy. 
JERRY: So you didn't get the job. 
JERRY: Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something. 
JERRY: Tell her you lost your itch. 
JERRY: Well you should tell her. 
JERRY: No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time. 
JERRY: It's not good.
JERRY: Well at breakfast everybody reads.
JERRY: You read during lunch?
JERRY: Oh, well.
JERRY: Ya, what's there to talk about.
JERRY: Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?
JERRY: At least you'll be talking.
JERRY: Hey, Al.
JERRY: Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.
JERRY: Ya.
JERRY: Me?
JERRY: Ya, see ya.
JERRY: (points to George) Ya.
JERRY: Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? 
JERRY: Oh, stop it.
JERRY: So you're not gonna come?
JERRY: Hey! 
JERRY: Nothing, what's doing with you?
JERRY: George this is Mickey.
JERRY: How's work going you guys?
JERRY: How do you stop a kid from growing?
JERRY: I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton.
JERRY: Hey, woahoh Fulton. It's me.
JERRY: Who couldn't.
JERRY: Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.
JERRY: Oh, alright ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....
JERRY: ..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Packyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of (wipes his brow) pizza and uh the uh and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling em (does juggling motions) he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. (Swallows and takes a breath) Well we all just lost it. (Fulton not laughing, stone faced) It was really really funny.
JERRY: Hey Phil how you doing?
JERRY: I got my health.
JERRY: (wiping his brow) He could use a couple laughs.
JERRY: I told it. (Answers the buzzer) Ya?
JERRY: Ya. (hits the button, opens the door. To Elaine) Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys.
JERRY: No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.
JERRY: If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: So what are you gonna do?
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: Ya, I could see that.
JERRY: No, me either.
JERRY: None.
JERRY: Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.
JERRY: (yelling) Yes I told him the Packyderm story!
JERRY: Towards what end?
JERRY: Hey Mick.
JERRY: (starts pulling them apart) Alright break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells)
JERRY: (to Mickey) Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?
JERRY: So what does he care if you put lifts in?
JERRY: (on phone) Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act (pauses for response from Adrian) No new material (Elaine enters) He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week, it killed. (waves hello to Elaine; pauses for response from Adrian) Thank you, thanks fo.. you will not regret this. Ok, Bye. (hangs up phone; to Elaine) Hey.
JERRY: So?
JERRY: Come on. How was your date?
JERRY: Ya how was it?
JERRY: Really.
JERRY: Why what happened?
JERRY: Just put it.
JERRY: (confused) He what?
JERRY: He took what out?
JERRY: He took It, Out?
JERRY: He couldn't.
JERRY: (motions of making out) Well you were involved in some sort of amorous...
JERRY: You mean he just
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: There was no mistaking it?
JERRY: So you were talking, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") you're having pleasant conversation, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") then all of sudden...
JERRY: It.
JERRY: Out.
JERRY: Well I, I can't believe this. I know Phil, he, he's a good friend of mine. We play softball together. How could this be?
JERRY: It.
JERRY: Out.
JERRY: Alright I'm going.
JERRY: Well how long you are going to keep this up?
JERRY: You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.
JERRY: Yes I do.
JERRY: I'm going to the hospital to see Fulton. I'm not even saying hello, I'm going right into material.
JERRY: Oh hey Phil.
JERRY: Well, y..you showed her who you are.
JERRY: Ya, that's the.. last thing you want to see. Well, next to last.
JERRY: Ya take it easy.
JERRY: (acting like he was walking on stage) Hey how ya doing? 
JERRY: This guy's belching out vitamins..
JERRY: (cont) and this whole justice league, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman. You mean to tell me Superman can't cover everything?
JERRY: For crying out loud, He's Superman. (Fulton stops laughing, Jerry's face is stunned) Fulton? 
JERRY: Good morning.
JERRY: Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over my side.
JERRY: C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!
JERRY: No, no, 12-8!
JERRY: I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.
JERRY: Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll uh try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. (Goes into his room, and comes back out with the jacket on.) Ahh, haven't worn this one in a long time.
JERRY: No, gore-tex. It's new. (Checks his pockets.) Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? 
JERRY: No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. Maybe we should ask him.
JERRY: Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?
JERRY: Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.
JERRY: But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.
JERRY: Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. (They go out into the hallway and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.) Hey, how ya doin.'
JERRY: Hey, is that my maple syrup? 
JERRY: Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?
JERRY: Oh, wow.
JERRY: Oh, come on!
JERRY: It's silly!
JERRY: Get outta here!
JERRY: Oh...yeah...uh you've never met my wife, Meryl? 
JERRY: You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...
JERRY: Ah - see the sense of humor? 
JERRY: Pardon?
JERRY: Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee.
JERRY: Adoring? 
JERRY: Ya sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? 
JERRY: I, uh...well...
JERRY: Well, I-I-I told my wife not to bring it.
JERRY: No, just Meryl.
JERRY: Because she's my wife! 
JERRY: (buzzes her up) Eh. (to Kramer) You know and I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! 
JERRY: See?
JERRY: Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? 
JERRY: Alright. (Elaine enters.)
JERRY: The fly-boy.
JERRY: Hey, where's George? 
JERRY: Hmm, So?
JERRY: Really.
JERRY: Ohhh, moisture?
JERRY: That's an open-lip kiss, alright.
JERRY: I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.
JERRY: Yeah, so?
JERRY: Here we go.
JERRY: No, never.
JERRY: Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?
JERRY: Hello.
JERRY: What are you doing here?
JERRY: Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. (Hands over Kramer's quilt.)
JERRY: Hello.
JERRY: Uh...I got married.
JERRY: Well, it was sudden.
JERRY: No, no, it was a small ceremony.
JERRY: Yes, yes, you have.
JERRY: You did, you did.
JERRY: I'm a good printer.
JERRY: Uncle Leo, wait!
JERRY: Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.
JERRY: I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.
JERRY: Listen, Ma...
JERRY: Mom, I'm not married.
JERRY: I'm not married!
JERRY: I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.
JERRY: Well, whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.)
JERRY: Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) I'll get it, I'll get it! 
JERRY: What is that? 
JERRY: That?
JERRY: Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.
JERRY: I Love you.
JERRY: Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.)
JERRY: (still watching tv; sounds like basketball) Bottle-wipe supercedes it.
JERRY: Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!
JERRY: Hello? 
JERRY: He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.
JERRY: Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay.
JERRY: Where you goin'?
JERRY: I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.
JERRY: I'm goin' home.
JERRY: I want to!
JERRY: Give me the clothes.
JERRY: Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.)
JERRY: I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.
JERRY: Do you want box or hanger?
JERRY: I'm sorry.
JERRY: It doesn't matter. I want a divorce.
JERRY: Yes, that's right.
JERRY: I'll tell you what happened. We got married.
JERRY: No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.
JERRY: It's alright, I want you to have it.
JERRY: We'll always have...pancakes.
JERRY: Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) "Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."
JERRY: You don't know? 
JERRY: Oh, that's gold, baby.
JERRY: I was saying 'baby' way before George!
JERRY: Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.
JERRY: He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly . I would like to have a good show.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!
JERRY: Hey, Ronnie.
JERRY: (To bartender) Can I have a club soda? 
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, I know.
JERRY: (looking at his nostrils) I don't...think so.
JERRY: I don't...I dunno.
JERRY: Oh, is this a bit?
JERRY: (turns to greet Kramer) Hey.
JERRY: Really! 
JERRY: Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.
JERRY: Good, good.
JERRY: Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: O.k., good, I'll see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.)
JERRY: Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...
JERRY: Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.
JERRY: ...that's why men hunt and women nest.
JERRY: Yea, ya, so...anyway what was I talking about.
JERRY: Hey, what's the deal? 
JERRY: Well, what is the matter with her? 
JERRY: Hey! 
JERRY: No! 
JERRY: Oh, I can take it.
JERRY: Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
JERRY: Hmm. So you feel "women and children first," in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.
JERRY: So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.
JERRY: Yeah, well, it's honest.
JERRY: Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.
JERRY: So, what was the fire? 
JERRY: By the way, did you see this? 
JERRY: It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.
JERRY: I should have let her have it! 
JERRY: Yeah, right.
JERRY: Yeah, that'd be something.
JERRY: But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? 
JERRY: Why can't I?
JERRY: You know what? 
JERRY: There's no precedent, baby!
JERRY: Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? 
JERRY: Oh, is this disruptive? 
JERRY: Security? 
JERRY: Boo!
JERRY: Hiss!
JERRY: Because she came down to the club and heckled me! 
JERRY: Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.
JERRY: You kept makin' all the stops?
JERRY: She got the promotion?
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: Too bad.
JERRY: Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'
JERRY: I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.
JERRY: Damn right! 
JERRY: Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.
JERRY: Yeah, well, it won't be long.
JERRY: Gotta go. (heads out on stage)
JERRY: I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need "the clown" in his title, as clown? 
JERRY: ...that's why men hunt and women nest.
JERRY: George - could I have a word?
JERRY: Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit.
JERRY: (To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?
JERRY: Didn't they just have a baby?
JERRY: Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.
JERRY: I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.
JERRY: She's makin' the three o'clock train.
JERRY: I bought him some kishka.
JERRY: It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.
JERRY: Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?
JERRY: No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No.
JERRY: No thanks.
JERRY: And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry)
JERRY: No lines.
JERRY: So when are we gonna see this baby? 
JERRY: (Looking toward beach) Oh this is interesting.
JERRY: Jane's topless. (They all look)
JERRY: Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
JERRY: Oh, in a minute, Carol.
JERRY: This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
JERRY: Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane enters)
JERRY: No thanks.
JERRY: So very gorgeous.
JERRY: Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
JERRY: Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit) And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.
JERRY: It's a must lie situation.
JERRY: You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.
JERRY: In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.
JERRY: Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.
JERRY: Okay. (He leaves)
JERRY: Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes outside)
JERRY: She's got greeting problems.
JERRY: Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of lobster)
JERRY: You got lobster for everybody?
JERRY: (Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.
JERRY: Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)
JERRY: Well what'd you mean?
JERRY: They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
JERRY: (looking of into the distance) I guess that's true...
JERRY: What do you want me to do? 
JERRY: You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
JERRY: I've never been called breathtaking either.
JERRY: Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
JERRY: How are you gonna do that?
JERRY: You might have.
JERRY: You won't.
JERRY: Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: Wait'll you get to know him.
JERRY: Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)
JERRY: It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.
JERRY: So what?
JERRY: But...
JERRY: Oh... You mean... shrinkage.
JERRY: So you feel you were short changed.
JERRY: Well, so what's the difference?
JERRY: Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.
JERRY: Women aren't like us.
JERRY: No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
JERRY: Isn't it common knowledge?
JERRY: (Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! 
JERRY: Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...
JERRY: Like a frightened turtle!
JERRY: No!
JERRY: No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.
JERRY: Yeah, the lobster'll scare him.
JERRY: (To George) Easy big fella.
JERRY: You told her?
JERRY: You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.
JERRY: Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. (Rachel shocked)
JERRY: (Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?
JERRY: Well, I guess I gotta go, too.
JERRY: I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
JERRY: They got some sort of program.
JERRY: Hey, isn't that Michael's car?
JERRY: You got a raise?
JERRY: I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
JERRY: Oh, when did that happen?
JERRY: Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
JERRY: Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.
JERRY: Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen "Girlie" Brown would be very proud of you.
JERRY: Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
JERRY: Oh, the beach.
JERRY: What is it that isn't working?
JERRY: (pointing to napkins; to Elaine) Could I get napkin over there?
JERRY: You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it)
JERRY: Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.
JERRY: If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
JERRY: (on the phone) Are you kidding? 
JERRY: What's happening?
JERRY: Oh yeah, I heard all about it.
JERRY: You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?
JERRY: I'll loan you my puffy shirt.
JERRY: What're you gonna talk about?
JERRY: Hello? 
JERRY: (shocked) Broke even.
JERRY: So it's all over?
JERRY: And what did you go back for? 
JERRY: Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
JERRY: Played cards last night.
JERRY: Broke even.
JERRY: Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! 
JERRY: What for?
JERRY: (shocked) What the hell was that?
JERRY: You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.
JERRY: Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.
JERRY: Bad.
JERRY: So you just did the opposite of everything?
JERRY: So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.
JERRY: Elaine ... look! 
JERRY: I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.
JERRY: Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.
JERRY: Yes?
JERRY: Uh huh?
JERRY: Oh, that's okay.
JERRY: Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.
JERRY: Sure. See, things always even out for me.
JERRY: It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck!
JERRY: (leaving; singing) She'll be coming around the mountain...
JERRY: Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?
JERRY: I can't believe it.
JERRY: Ya?
JERRY: (buzzes Elaine up) Come on up.
JERRY: That's a great place!
JERRY: George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.
JERRY: Hi Elaine.
JERRY: How're things going?
JERRY: Why? 
JERRY: The jewel thief?
JERRY: What else?
JERRY: Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, (has his one hand up and his other hand down) he was down. Now he's up, (switches the positioning of his hands) you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?
JERRY: Is that the end of it?
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: He knows what he's doing.
JERRY: Opposite.
JERRY: Why'd you have to eat so many?
JERRY: Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
JERRY: Don't say that.
JERRY: Ah ... let's call it even.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: That's alright, I got it.
JERRY: Elaine, stop it.
JERRY: I'm sorry.
JERRY: Oh, she worked at Doubleday...?
JERRY: Right, just like you.
JERRY: Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh...
JERRY: I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. (Miss Rhode Island laughs.)
JERRY: Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.
JERRY: And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.
JERRY: The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.
JERRY: No, it's part of the contest rules.
JERRY: I don't know, she just sits there.
JERRY: I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. (Picks up the phone and dials.)
JERRY: Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? 
JERRY: Of course, they're polyester.
JERRY: Why do they wear polyester?
JERRY: You're going to do something about it?
JERRY: Hello, Karen? 
JERRY: I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?
JERRY: Rhode Island.
JERRY: Look, do you want to go or not? 
JERRY: Congratulations!
JERRY: Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
JERRY: Like what?
JERRY: Really! 
JERRY: Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! 
JERRY: Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just "recede into the night," if you know what I mean.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: I'm not going to "defile" her!
JERRY: But -
JERRY: But wait a minute...
JERRY: That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen -
JERRY: Alright, Kramer!
JERRY: Hey, come on!
JERRY: I'll be right back. (Leaves the table.)
JERRY: Well, here we are...
JERRY: Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell.
JERRY: And that waist cincher, that was the topper!
JERRY: Yes, I poo-poo.
JERRY: I don't want to stop her!
JERRY: Yeah, so do you. (George enters with a newspaper.)
JERRY: See what?
JERRY: Boy, they really do sound comfortable.
JERRY: I'm working in Atlantic City.
JERRY: Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?
JERRY: You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. (Picks up the phone.) She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...
JERRY: Hi, Mr. Pitt! 
JERRY: Hey Elaine, it's me.
JERRY: We're going to Atlantic City.
JERRY: Today, right now! 
JERRY: Why not?
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Good. How was the roulette?
JERRY: Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!
JERRY: What the hell is that?
JERRY: Wait a second. (Grabs the icebucket off the counter.) This'll scare 'em off. (Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. Jerry gets back into bed.) Well, good night, Ollie.
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Birds?
JERRY: What are you looking at? 
JERRY: No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! 
JERRY: Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! 
JERRY: Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.
JERRY: I heard those doves were really incredible.
JERRY: It's like watching an animal get tortured.
JERRY: Oh, great! 
JERRY: That's a shame.
JERRY: Why did you give him MY number?
JERRY: I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
JERRY: Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?
JERRY: Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? 
JERRY: Hi Julie.
JERRY: Just had a big bowl of Kix.
JERRY: Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs.
JERRY: Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?
JERRY: People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
JERRY: It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.
JERRY: I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
JERRY: What was that?
JERRY: Certainly are.
JERRY: All right. You're in MY face.
JERRY: (on phone) Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil.
JERRY: He doesn't even care if a man answers.
JERRY: Bye bye
JERRY: Well, that all depends. . .
JERRY: Yeah, so?
JERRY: Is that a fact?
JERRY: No it isn't.
JERRY: Yes you did.
JERRY: She could have.
JERRY: Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.
JERRY: Obviously.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Well, it has nothing to do with you.
JERRY: Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.
JERRY: And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
JERRY: Ah, no , I don't think so.
JERRY: We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
JERRY: Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.
JERRY: Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.
JERRY: Hello Newman.
JERRY: No, no I don't. Why?
JERRY: I suppose.
JERRY: I don't know. Nothing.?
JERRY: You two know each other?
JERRY: . . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: You liked, Newman?
JERRY: No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.
JERRY: . . . HE ended it?
JERRY: No, no of course not.
JERRY: What tee?
JERRY: Newman! 
JERRY: No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? 
JERRY: No, there's less.
JERRY: No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.
JERRY: Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.
JERRY: No,, but thank you.
JERRY: Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.
JERRY: No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.
JERRY: Well, what did you do that for? 
JERRY: Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.
JERRY: Hi Julie.
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Hi, how are you, Elaine? 
JERRY: How do you know THAT?
JERRY: It's Jerry.
JERRY: Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!
JERRY: Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?
JERRY: No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?
JERRY: Noit your type?
JERRY: Well, how come?
JERRY: What, what is wrong with her?
JERRY: You don't think she's attractive?
JERRY: Okay, Newman, thanks a lot.
JERRY: No, thank you.
JERRY: But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?
JERRY: What are you so worried about this for?
JERRY: He did?
JERRY: So it had nothing to do with you.
JERRY: No, I don't think so.
JERRY: Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? 
JERRY: Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?
JERRY: Yeah,, me too.
JERRY: Where you going?
JERRY: You're going to see Genderson?
JERRY: You had how many dates with him? 
JERRY: And . .
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Why are you looking at my face?
JERRY: Where am I going to look?
JERRY: . . . I can't.
JERRY: Newman!
JERRY: All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.
JERRY: You're going out with the stationery store guy?
JERRY: Hello, what? 
JERRY: Your friend, Noreen.
JERRY: If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.
JERRY: If you don't believe me, ask her.
JERRY: Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.
JERRY: Check the pile.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: Oh.
JERRY: Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.
JERRY: She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.
JERRY: Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone.
JERRY: No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station.
JERRY: Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.
JERRY: Oh, go ahead.
JERRY: Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.
JERRY: So was I right? 
JERRY: I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now.
JERRY: Oh, I know you are.
JERRY: I did.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: No?
JERRY: Well--
JERRY: You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem.
JERRY: Why, because I threw the card out? 
JERRY: I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy.
JERRY: (as Kristin is storming out) Well, but, you see, I saved something! 
JERRY: No, they're old cards from my grandmother.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them.
JERRY: I don't know, it's ten dollars.
JERRY: Oh so what.
JERRY: Oh, get out of here.
JERRY: Alright, alright, I'll cash the checks.
JERRY: It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?
JERRY: You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?
JERRY: I mean really, what's the point of saving it? 
JERRY: Absolutely.
JERRY: So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.
JERRY: Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me...
JERRY: Could you?
JERRY: Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.
JERRY: Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?
JERRY: So was I right about the flirting? 
JERRY: Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?
JERRY: Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? 
JERRY: Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?
JERRY: Why does he do that?
JERRY: Oh, you know.
JERRY: That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.
JERRY: Okay, sixty bucks from Nana.
JERRY: Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.
JERRY: Excuse me?
JERRY: You're just answering phones!
JERRY: Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men
JERRY: Right you are.
JERRY: Oh, she had an itch.
JERRY: By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks.
JERRY: (answering) Hello?
JERRY: Uncle Leo!
JERRY: Nana's missing?
JERRY: I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.
JERRY: I think Chemical Bank.
JERRY: Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. (To Kramer) I never should have cashed those checks!
JERRY: Just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces Kramer) Well? 
JERRY: It's your fault!
JERRY: Would you?
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Yeah, my grandma's missing.
JERRY: Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.
JERRY: Like a grandmother, why?
JERRY: Yes, it is!
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: Leo?
JERRY: Uncle Leo! 
JERRY: Oh.
JERRY: He'll be here any second.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah.
JERRY: No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.
JERRY: Please-
JERRY: It's not necessary.
JERRY: I can't, I can't take it.
JERRY: Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!
JERRY: You know what? 
JERRY: I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.
JERRY: This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-
JERRY: -programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'
JERRY: My Nana?
JERRY: I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.
JERRY: Yes, he is.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Look, she's cutting up an Almond Joy.
JERRY: You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.
JERRY: (surveying the restaurant) Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it!
JERRY: (feeling face) Good shave today...
JERRY: I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little...
JERRY: (pause) Yeah, I guess.
JERRY: ...So how's Noreen?
JERRY: Already? 
JERRY: A Long Talker.
JERRY: (pause) All right; let's move it out.
JERRY: Hey, isn't that George's father?
JERRY: I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.
JERRY: I believe he is wearing a cape.
JERRY: Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.
JERRY: You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.
JERRY: Just, uh, plop it on the counter there.
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: Let me call him back... Hello? 
JERRY: (is redialing) I should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.
JERRY: So listen...
JERRY: I got a date!
JERRY: She knew who I was! 
JERRY: No, why should I? 
JERRY: I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed...
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: Well, I'm sure you're not... Totally Depleted.
JERRY: So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.
JERRY: I am very excited about this date! 
JERRY: She suggested it!
JERRY: She's very assimilated.
JERRY: Paul again?
JERRY: I tried! 
JERRY: No. Jacket and tie: no cape.
JERRY: Yes, I will.
JERRY: No, go ahead, I second-hand smoke two packs a day.
JERRY: (pause. Stops tapping his leg) 'scuse me?
JERRY: Who are you?
JERRY: (stands, puzzled, it's not sinking in) W-what do you mean?
JERRY: (pause) You're Donna Chang?
JERRY: Oh. No. What, you mean because of the "Chang"?
JERRY: I didn't think so.
JERRY: No. Not Chinese. Not even Asian.
JERRY: Well, she's... like you.
JERRY: Well, it's false advertising, see? 
JERRY: Well, she is a woman.
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?
JERRY: Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?
JERRY: Wha--you have a low sperm count?
JERRY: Nnnoo--I don't want 'em. (starts backing away as Kramer follows him around the room carrying the underwear)
JERRY: Look! 
JERRY: I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!
JERRY: (re the underwear pile) Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
JERRY: Did they uncross the lines yet?
JERRY: (long pause -- did he hear "ridicurous" -- should he say something -- can't decide if he should. Finally...) Did you say, "ridicurous"?
JERRY: (pause) I thought you said... "ridicurous." (Donna looks puzzled)
JERRY: Oh, what are you doing here?
JERRY: The rines are crossed?
JERRY: Did I?
JERRY: Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.
JERRY: Gee, I never thought of that.
JERRY: Have you ever spent any time with these people...?
JERRY: And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.
JERRY: Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers...
JERRY: You went back to the Jockeys?
JERRY: (pause as he realizes) Oh, no.
JERRY: The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer, say it isn't so.
JERRY: Don't you need a little... help?
JERRY: First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.
JERRY: So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! 
JERRY: Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman: anything you say she does!
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: (hits button) Come on up. (opens door a little)
JERRY: Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?
JERRY: First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did.
JERRY: Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! 
JERRY: You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...
JERRY: Oh, Miss Changstein! 
JERRY: Why? 
JERRY: Wow! 
JERRY: Tonight?
JERRY: So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
JERRY: Confucius, huh?
JERRY: (pause) You know, you're not Chinese...
JERRY: Hey! 
JERRY: Elaine was... in a rush.
JERRY: (pause, to Donna) You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name...
JERRY: Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese. (buys a newspaper out of a machine)
JERRY: Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish...
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: So, she got you to join a book club?
JERRY: Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits on a couch.) Hey, what about this one?
JERRY: So, what's your first book?
JERRY: It's kinda old, isn't it?
JERRY: Oh, yeah.
JERRY: No. You?
JERRY: New couch, baby!
JERRY: I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? 
JERRY: Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.
JERRY: Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?
JERRY: Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.
JERRY: It's here!
JERRY: Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: What made you resurrect that old idea?
JERRY: I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?
JERRY: Oh, Kramer, I -
JERRY: Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? 
JERRY: Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.
JERRY: Uh, no. Should I have?
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: Ah ha...
JERRY: I can't wait.
JERRY: Clever.
JERRY: Yes.
JERRY: You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.
JERRY: So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?
JERRY: Well, would you apologize for me? 
JERRY: Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.
JERRY: So, what's good tonight?
JERRY: Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.
JERRY: Why not?
JERRY: So, you won't eat the pizza?
JERRY: Really.
JERRY: Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?
JERRY: Really!
JERRY: Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! 
JERRY: Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?
JERRY: Oh, boy.
JERRY: Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.)
JERRY: Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.
JERRY: Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (Jerry smiles. George laughs.) So, how's the book coming? 
JERRY: So, what's it about?
JERRY: Holly Go-Lightly.
JERRY: Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?
JERRY: Big surprise.
JERRY: You're not very bright, are you?
JERRY: Why don't you rent the movie?
JERRY: Oh...well...
JERRY: We should get him something.
JERRY: Whoa!
JERRY: Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?
JERRY: No games? 
JERRY: Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?
JERRY: What is his stand...on abortion?
JERRY: How do you know?
JERRY: Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.
JERRY: Hey, what's happenin.'
JERRY: You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.
JERRY: Okay. Hi, Poppie.
JERRY: I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.
JERRY: Okay. I'll get it. (Goes into the bedroom.)
JERRY: ...the...the...
JERRY: This puddle on my sofa!
JERRY: I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!
JERRY: Well, I guess I have no choice.
JERRY: I was hoping you'd offer. (The intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
JERRY: 'Kay. (Buzzes them in.)
JERRY: Your boyfriend, he's taking it out.
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: Oh, really. (Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.)
JERRY: Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.
JERRY: Could you?
JERRY: George is taking it.
JERRY: He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.
JERRY: I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? 
JERRY: I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" thing.
JERRY: As we all do.
JERRY: Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?
JERRY: You're good with the mothers.
JERRY: Maybe you should date the mothers.
JERRY: Oh, you got something goin'.
JERRY: What do you need a hammer for?
JERRY: Oh, yeah! 
JERRY: Nah, I don't think so.
JERRY: Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?
JERRY: Hey, guess what? 
JERRY: Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.
JERRY: Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.
JERRY: Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.
JERRY: She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?
JERRY: (watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this?
JERRY: (stares at George, incredulous) "Back on"? 
JERRY: (laughing) What for?
JERRY: Unbuttoned, or all the way off?
JERRY: Of course.
JERRY: What, again? 
JERRY: (picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt off?
JERRY: Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.
JERRY: (trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.
JERRY: He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. 
JERRY: No, you'd have to be crazy.
JERRY: Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad.
JERRY: So lemme get this straight: you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an éclair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, "What the hell, I'll just eat some trash."
JERRY: Was it in the trash?
JERRY: Then it was trash.
JERRY: But it was in the cylinder!
JERRY: Adjacent to refuse, is refuse.
JERRY: Was it eaten?
JERRY: Well, that's garbage.
JERRY: Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum.
JERRY: Hey!
JERRY: What's with you?
JERRY: What stone?
JERRY: What is that, anyway?
JERRY: Oh, that's gotta hurt.
JERRY: Good for you.
JERRY: Y'know what you should do now? 
JERRY: Kramer, are you still on this? 
JERRY: Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's better than eating it.
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: (pointing at TV) Hey, that's her!
JERRY: (smiling and excited) Well, here we are.
JERRY: How did you stay on that beam like that? 
JERRY: Oh boy...
JERRY: I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a "magical world" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.
JERRY: Well, you know. I mean... I dunno.
JERRY: Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...
JERRY: You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...
JERRY: Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus.
JERRY: See, again, I really don't feel that...
JERRY: Could we stop?
JERRY: All right. Let's just drop it.
JERRY: So lemme ask you this: how long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night.
JERRY: (sarcastic) Oh, great.
JERRY: Between Poland and Morgan?
JERRY: Kramer! 
JERRY: What happened, did you pass the stone?
JERRY: Strike two!
JERRY: You're behind in the count.
JERRY: I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.
JERRY: If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.
JERRY: We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.
JERRY: Yeah, well, y'know what? 
JERRY: Yeah, well you're going.
JERRY: "Greatest Show on Earth"!
JERRY: Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.
JERRY: Well, break a leg.
JERRY: Eh, show biz...
JERRY: Boy, those capes are really coming back.
JERRY: What is that sound?
JERRY: Oh, why not?
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: I’ll have the, ah, turkey club without the bacon.
JERRY: She does have a way.
JERRY: Well they do work on tips.
JERRY: Ah, I should have got the egg white omelet.
JERRY: The omelet. Damn.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Not possible.
JERRY: Lannie, how was the trip?
JERRY: Yeah, well that relationships really got a lot of potential.
JERRY: Oh no, it's Kenny Bania.
JERRY: (quietly) Oh, he's this awful comedian.
JERRY: Hey Kenny. (with some fake enthusiasm, just to be polite)
JERRY: Elaine, George (introducing them to Bania with less enthusiasm)
JERRY: How's it going?
JERRY: No kidding.
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: Ahh, I’m a 40. Why?
JERRY: Well I don't know if I ...
JERRY: Well ... ok, I guess (voice trailing off)
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, lucky me. (sips coffee)
JERRY: Well, go in there and talk to her. She's not going to put ‘em on the glass.
JERRY: Pull yourself together. Your going in there soldier! 
JERRY: Get in there. (he pushes George in the direction of the restaurant)
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: YEAH? 
JERRY: ALL RIGHT, COME ON UP (Jerry puts his head down - he's not looking forward to Kenny Bania)
JERRY: Well, well, why are you getting rid of your refrigerator? 
JERRY: What for?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yes, yes, I heard.
JERRY: No, it's ok.
JERRY: All right, all right. (trying on the suit jacket)
JERRY: Ok, Yeah all right.
JERRY: Yes, yes, he is.
JERRY: Dinner?
JERRY: Yeah, I’ll see you.
JERRY: Yeah, that's a deal. That's a terrible deal. I don't want to go out to dinner with him. I’d rather make my own suit.
JERRY: Hey. (raises hands into “fists of encouragement”)
JERRY: I love the day date. No wine, No shower.
JERRY: So you just pretended it didn’t bother you?
JERRY: Boy, It's the way they just slip it in there too.
JERRY: Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out?
JERRY: Oh, a walk, well --
JERRY: Or something. Yeah, that's a date.
JERRY: Course you know there is always the possibility, that she called an audible.
JERRY: Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didn’t like the looks of the defense and changed the play.
JERRY: Uh huh.
JERRY: You did?
JERRY: Yeah. You said you liked horse manure.
JERRY: (quietly) Mm-hm.
JERRY: And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?
JERRY: I’m just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.
JERRY: My honest opinion, I think she made it up.
JERRY: Aaa. Well ... you want something to eat, don't you?
JERRY: Well I’m glad it's working out.
JERRY: Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place.
JERRY: Is she?
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: Oh, Hi.
JERRY: Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you?
JERRY: No I haven't?
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: (hangs up the phone) Yeah, I really needed that suit.
JERRY: Mm. That's fantastic. (he could care less)
JERRY: No I don't.
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: No, not yet.
JERRY: I’ll have the salmon.
JERRY: Another time? 
JERRY: No, no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts.
JERRY: I’m not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want.
JERRY: Then that's the meal.
JERRY: I didn’t tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog?
JERRY: All right, fine. Get the soup!
JERRY: So he just gets soup. He wants to save the meal. So now I got to do it all over again.
JERRY: I don't know? 
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Elaine you're missing the whole point.
JERRY: The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal.
JERRY: You see -- ah, uh ...
JERRY: A bowl, ok?
JERRY: As a mater of fact, he did.
JERRY: It's like I’m talking to my Aunt Sylvia here.
JERRY: Well, I have some money. What do you need? 
JERRY: So is she working? 
JERRY: Have you said anything to her?
JERRY: Are you going to say anything?
JERRY: I’ll have an egg white omelet.
JERRY: Yeah, that was bad.
JERRY: Oh, no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down. (George & Jerry each slide to the end of their booth seats)
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Actually, I did. I put it on last night and slept in it.
JERRY: ... Oh, I’m joking.
JERRY: Why don't you get a sandwich?
JERRY: OK ... (nodding his head up and down) This is it ‘cha know
JERRY: This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy.
JERRY: Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal.
JERRY: I tried to do that.
JERRY: Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction.
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Where's Simon?
JERRY: When's he leaving? 
JERRY: Ah, no thanks.
JERRY: (on the phone) Hello? 
JERRY: Hey, what size suit are you?
JERRY: 40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?
JERRY: Great, its yours. I can't stand the sight of it. Elaine, here’s the car keys. (tosses her the keys)
JERRY: Yo?
JERRY: I don't have your suit. I gave it away.
JERRY: Well it's gone. I’m sorry. Good-bye Bania.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Ok.
JERRY: Nothing.
JERRY: You want food, don't cha? 
JERRY: All right, go ahead
JERRY: What are we doing out here? 
JERRY: Oh, w-what are you saying? 
JERRY: We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk.
JERRY: So what's going on with Simon? 
JERRY: Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, “No egg white omelets.” Look at that.
JERRY: Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet?
JERRY: All right, just give me a western. (unhappy)
JERRY: Not fair.
JERRY: She's on your turf.
JERRY: You're the best.
JERRY: Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected, outwardly.
JERRY: Well, there's nothing left. There's no food.
JERRY: Why'd she get fired?
JERRY: Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he?
JERRY: I don't have it. You want half my omelet? 
JERRY: Ready to go Lois?
JERRY: Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.
JERRY: Duncan Meyers!
JERRY: Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.
JERRY: Hi oh.
JERRY: She couldn't make it.
JERRY: I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.
JERRY: Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.
JERRY: I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .
JERRY: Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher.
JERRY: He was down at the other end. So he yells out, "Ready, On your mark, Get set, " and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.
JERRY: By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.
JERRY: And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.
JERRY: I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.
JERRY: He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man that's some tart cider!
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?
JERRY: He say anything?
JERRY: Oh, nothing in particular.
JERRY: I did not cheat.
JERRY: Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.
JERRY: Yes
JERRY: Faster than a speeding bullet Lois.
JERRY: I couldn’t tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that
JERRY: Wow, a communist. That's something.
JERRY: The Daily Worker has personal ads?
JERRY: Yours or hers?
JERRY: Wow, look at you. So you got the job.
JERRY: Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for? 
JERRY: Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.
JERRY: That's not bad.
JERRY: I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?
JERRY: Well, I . . . [sees George]
JERRY: I'm sorry, uh,
JERRY: Oh, George Costanza , Kennedy High.
JERRY: This is Lois.
JERRY: I'm I'm a comedian.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?
JERRY: You really used to have a think full head of hair.
JERRY: yeah, yeah.
JERRY: Well you've really built yourself up into something.
JERRY: Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this.
JERRY: Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that canvas?
JERRY: George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long.
JERRY: I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: George!
JERRY: Did I get a head start?
JERRY: You satisfied? 
JERRY: No, no, no, another race - out of the question.
JERRY: All right! 
JERRY: And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus
JERRY: So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist. You just called the woman for a date.
JERRY: Hello, oh hi Duncan, 4:00 o'clock tomorrow? 
JERRY: Hi how are you?
JERRY: What's the matter?
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Don't worry Lois. I'll think of something.
JERRY: I need a miracle.
JERRY: Yes, Mr. Beviacqua
JERRY: Yes Mr. Bevilacqua.
JERRY: Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will.
JERRY: Come on. Lets go
JERRY: What's it doin here?
JERRY: Oh, Bruline. Newman's got the same one.
JERRY: He's fantastic.
JERRY: You loaned her Pitt's racquet?
JERRY: Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump over the net.
JERRY: Bye bye
JERRY: Hm, really?
JERRY: Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket.
JERRY: Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer. It shows at least he's making an effort.
JERRY: I'm glad you enjoyed it.
JERRY: It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman.
JERRY: And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She says, "That's funny." ... That's funny!
JERRY: I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something!
JERRY: What noise?
JERRY: What blah?
JERRY: Oh, you think she was refunding?
JERRY: In a manner of speaking.
JERRY: Thanks.
JERRY: A matron?
JERRY: uh, well I can't help you there (weakly).
JERRY: Kramer you're going to have to face her some time
JERRY: Why didn't you just ask her for it?
JERRY: Yeah
JERRY: C'mon up.
JERRY: So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?
JERRY: He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?
JERRY: Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it?
JERRY: Stealing? 
JERRY: Hey
JERRY: So what happened with Kramer's mother?
JERRY: What's she like?
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it?
JERRY: Cosmo?
JERRY: Cosmo
JERRY: Hi, is Sandy here?
JERRY: I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
JERRY: So the roommate laughed at everything I said.
JERRY: It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse "ha's." You know those?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.
JERRY: So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.
JERRY: Can't be done, huh?
JERRY: "The Switch."
JERRY: I wonder.
JERRY: They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.
JERRY: The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now! 
JERRY: I couldn't do it without you.
JERRY: Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? 
JERRY: Yeah, sure we will.
JERRY: All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a ménage à trois with her and her roommate.
JERRY: And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises.
JERRY: At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.
JERRY: The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.
JERRY: Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it: They're roommates. She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back. She's not gonna do that.
JERRY: It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.
JERRY: You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe its Manage A Trois.
JERRY: Uh?
JERRY: Hey
JERRY: Ah, that's a shame.
JERRY: Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.
JERRY: No actually, she took it pretty well.
JERRY: She's into it.
JERRY: The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too.
JERRY: Oh, it's a scene man.
JERRY: What are you talking about? 
JERRY: I can't. I'm not an orgy guy.
JERRY: Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? 
JERRY: Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.
JERRY: Hey, what happened? 
JERRY: What do you mean you got caught?
JERRY: I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.
JERRY: Hi Cosmo.
JERRY: Hey, doesn't Newman have a Bruline racquet?
JERRY: Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?
JERRY: Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.
JERRY:  You sure you don't want the tickets?
JERRY:  I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
JERRY:  I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.
JERRY:  Maybe he didn't know?
JERRY:  Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.
JERRY:  I asked.  Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian football.
JERRY:  Come on, take them.  You could take Bonnie.
JERRY:  What do you think?
JERRY:  Yeah, sleeping arrangements.  So, you haven't, uh...
JERRY:  Aah.
JERRY:  The Dentist?
JERRY:  Oh, no.  I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with it.
JERRY:  Yeah, I blamed it on you.  Hi Tim.
JERRY:  Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.
JERRY:  Hey.  How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?
JERRY:  Here.  Two tickets.  Have a good time.
JERRY:  No no no.  No dinner.
JERRY:  Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift.  I know, it's a label maker.  The Label Baby Junior.  Yeah, I hear they're good.  Well, label me thankful.  Okay, well you enjoy those tickets.  Buh-bye.
JERRY:  Come in.
JERRY:  What is it?
JERRY:  Kramer, why do you have to (noticing Newman)  Hello, Newman.
JERRY:  Take what?
JERRY:  So why don't you leave it at Newman's?
JERRY:  So that's here?
JERRY:  I don't wanna be Switzerland.
JERRY:  Alright, soldier boys, let's fall out.
JERRY:  Yeah, yeah.
JERRY:  Yeah.
JERRY:  Ok.
JERRY:  Hey.
JERRY:  Yes it is.  I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior.
JERRY:  Tim Whatley?
JERRY:  One Tim Whatley!
JERRY:  The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.
JERRY:  Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing.  Perhaps it's an homage.
JERRY:  Well how did he react when you gave it to him?
JERRY:  He repeated the name of the gift?
JERRY:  Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it.
JERRY:  Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, "Oh. Tube socks."  What are you gonna do about it?
JERRY:  Why'd you get him a gift anyway?
JERRY:  Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm alarge.
JERRY:  Male roommate, huh?
JERRY:  Is this a problem?
JERRY:  Well, maybe he's --
JERRY:  So he's an eligible receiver.
JERRY:  What's stopping them?
JERRY:  What does he look like?
JERRY:  He looks like you and he's working from the inside?
JERRY:  Not you.
JERRY:  We'll take a check please.
JERRY:  I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.
JERRY:  Many times.  You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet.
JERRY:  Hey.
JERRY:  So what?
JERRY:  Oh, maybe he's got no hot water.
JERRY:  Are you through?
JERRY:  The wedding is off? 
JERRY:  I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.
JERRY:  Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? 
JERRY:  Possibly.
JERRY:  You may have a point.
JERRY:  Alright, I'll call him.
JERRY:  Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives. (Picks up phone and dials)  Hello Tim? 
JERRY:  Thanks.
JERRY:  What are you gonna do about the roommate?
JERRY:  Well, the pickle breath is a good start.
JERRY:  What do you want?
JERRY:  I'm not letting you cheat, Newman.  You're not getting anywhere near that board.
JERRY:  You're not a little anything, Newman.  So just pack it up and move it out of here.
JERRY:  I dunno, watch it on TV I guess.  Why?
JERRY:  You're going to the Super Bowl?
JERRY:  What's his name?
JERRY:  That's my ticket!
JERRY: (as Newman leaves)  Newman!
JERRY:  Newman.  He's going with Newman.
JERRY:  Newman's his mailman.
JERRY:  He is merry, I'll give him that.  (notices a cactus on the table) What's this plant for?
JERRY:  Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.
JERRY:  What?
JERRY:  What about the label maker?
JERRY:  Wait a minute, that's my ticket! 
JERRY:  So, how did you get up there? 
JERRY:  Then how'd you get up there?
JERRY:  That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.
JERRY:  You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West? 
JERRY:  Obviously.
JERRY:  Yeah, well I don't trust this guy.  I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.
JERRY:  Hey.  What are you doing?
JERRY:  My door?
JERRY: (still outside)  What was that?
JERRY: (after entering)  The bedroom!
JERRY:  I see you, Newman! 
JERRY:  So she kicked him out of the apartment.
JERRY:  Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.
JERRY:  That's not a good role for you.
JERRY:  You unwittingly made a major commitment.  That's a lot of pressure.
JERRY:  You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.
JERRY:  He was shouldering.
JERRY:  Where are you going?
JERRY:  Oh, well here.  Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it again.
JERRY:  So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?
JERRY: (walking out)  Thanks for having me over, guys.
JERRY:  Alright, I'll see you later.
JERRY:  Ah, Tim Whatley.  Out scalping?
JERRY:  Are you serious, what about Elaine?
JERRY:  Oh.  (notices a car being jacked up by a tow truck)  Hey, isn't this Kramer's car? 
JERRY:  Yeah, see you there.
JERRY:  H... G... F.  Seat four.  One, two, three... f-- Hello Newman.
JERRY:  Oh, it's enchanting.
JERRY:  An inch! 
JERRY: So you called the cop a pig?
JERRY: Didn't you explain that to the cop?
JERRY: (to George) Hey.
JERRY: Oh yeah, I knew.
JERRY: He told me a few months ago.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though.
JERRY: No, he was on his regular bed.
JERRY: He swore me to secrecy.
JERRY: It's not like you're my wife.
JERRY: Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.
JERRY: That's right, you let him have it.
JERRY: Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?
JERRY: His illness is your business.
JERRY: If not now, when?
JERRY: If I told you, you woulda given it away.
JERRY: No, but he would've read your face.
JERRY: Do you ever win at poker?
JERRY: The Jujy Fruits?
JERRY: I never heard her say hi.
JERRY: It's like a game of tag.
JERRY: Where you going?
JERRY: You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?
JERRY: Hey. How'd it go with Gary?
JERRY: (suspicious) Really?
JERRY: You look like something's on your mind.
JERRY: So, that's your poker face.
JERRY: No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.
JERRY: All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? 
JERRY: What you got, a pair of bullets?
JERRY: Two pair? 
JERRY: Oh my God, you got a flush! 
JERRY: A full house? 
JERRY: So what was wrong with him?
JERRY: What kind of person is this? 
JERRY: I don't even think you could do it.
JERRY: Yeah, I guess you could.
JERRY: Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease?
JERRY: Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone)
JERRY: Why not?
JERRY: So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't?
JERRY: Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! 
JERRY: Why didn't he tell me?
JERRY: I don't think I can be that nice.
JERRY: Gary?
JERRY: Is that from my gift certificate?
JERRY: (through gritted teeth) Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.
JERRY: I don't think so.
JERRY: Okay. (shuts mouth)
JERRY: Hey. Look at you. Wha... what's this?
JERRY: You look like a pirate.
JERRY: (gesturing) This is Gary.
JERRY: Can't see on your right side?
JERRY: Hey, do you know what the Whip does?
JERRY: The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.
JERRY: Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? 
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: And you know what else? 
JERRY: Yeah!
JERRY: Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
JERRY: She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?
JERRY: Walked right over to her table.
JERRY: You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? 
JERRY: What if you get involved with a woman? 
JERRY: So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out (as mortician) 'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'. (as Mrs Costanza, horrified) Aahh!
JERRY: (unimpressed) I, really can't say.
JERRY: It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look (searches for word) stupid. (to salesman) I'm sorry.
JERRY: Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?
JERRY: Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!
JERRY: Hey! 
JERRY: All right! 
JERRY: I'm sorry.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: You know, Gary (slams shut the door) I had a little chat with George the other day...
JERRY: (advancing on Gary) ...and he told me that that... (becomes indistinct)
JERRY: Gimme that thing!
JERRY: Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? 
JERRY: You stink. You know you stink. What is this?
JERRY: Oh. Your ballet tickets.
JERRY: No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.
JERRY: A beard?
JERRY: Yes.
JERRY: Why are you doing this?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Well what about me?
JERRY: It sounds like an excellent idea.
JERRY: You can't go wrong with pouty.
JERRY: Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?
JERRY: Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.
JERRY: And did they suspect anything?
JERRY: And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.
JERRY: You said that already.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?
JERRY: Yeah, but?
JERRY: So?
JERRY: Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?
JERRY: You think you can get him to just change teams? 
JERRY: Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.
JERRY: Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.
JERRY: They're only comfortable with *their* equipment.
JERRY: Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.
JERRY: You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters.
JERRY: Are you that desperate?
JERRY: What are you looking for?
JERRY: Sorry. I don't have any tupperware.
JERRY: What about a plastic bag?
JERRY: What is the difference?
JERRY: So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?
JERRY: What did you say to her?
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: As you see it?
JERRY: Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?
JERRY: You know, you're little hair hat there.
JERRY: Don't you think she could tell?
JERRY: Are you kidding? 
JERRY: Have you noticed people staring at your head?
JERRY: Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.
JERRY: Oh, I'll split a cab with you.
JERRY: Hi Sarge.
JERRY: What's that?
JERRY: Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?
JERRY: Really.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: I admit it. I don't watch it.
JERRY: The poly?
JERRY: Yes. Melrose Place.
JERRY: Well I do.
JERRY: Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.
JERRY: And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.
JERRY: The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.
JERRY: It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.
JERRY: I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.
JERRY: Hey you know what? 
JERRY: Did you shake it up?
JERRY: You gotta shake it up.
JERRY: Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.
JERRY: So tonight are you going to make the move?
JERRY: Hey there he is. So what happened? 
JERRY: How so?
JERRY: She's bald?
JERRY: Women go bald?
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Good to have you back.
JERRY: She's as good as anybody else.
JERRY: Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.
JERRY: So George, how do I beat this lie detector?
JERRY: Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.
JERRY: All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Get out! 
JERRY: Elaine, do you know what you've done? 
JERRY: Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY: 129 West 81st street.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: (He hesitates) Yes! 
JERRY: He went back? 
JERRY: I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.
JERRY: You can't. That's why they lose very few players.
JERRY: Well there's always a place for you, on our team.
JERRY: Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.
JERRY: Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.
JERRY: All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.
JERRY: Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.
JERRY: I would think.
JERRY: (scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.
JERRY: Yeah? 
JERRY: Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.
JERRY: Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? 
JERRY: I have to go over to my grandmother's.
JERRY: I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
JERRY: No, we have time.
JERRY: Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.
JERRY: Like toothpaste?
JERRY: There's a squeeze ketchup.
JERRY: Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?
JERRY: I really don't see the difference.
JERRY: It's subtle.
JERRY: (looking ahead) Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh.
JERRY: Ah, she's with her friend Wendy.
JERRY: Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
JERRY: Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.
JERRY: Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that.
JERRY: No, I told you I admire your hearing.
JERRY: No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.
JERRY: Bye.
JERRY: (adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.
JERRY: Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time.
JERRY: (to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?
JERRY: She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.
JERRY: Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.
JERRY: What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.
JERRY: Speak of the devil.
JERRY: What for?
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: (reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.
JERRY: (still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.
JERRY: Hello, uncle Leo!
JERRY: Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
JERRY: Hi Nana.
JERRY: Yes. (kisses Nana) Yes of course.
JERRY: (also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it.
JERRY: Will you stop it.
JERRY: Uncle Leo! 
JERRY: I'm just not getting any hot water.
JERRY: Thanks, Julio.
JERRY: Huh?
JERRY: What's going on here?
JERRY: (suspicious) Well, then what're you doing?
JERRY: What for?
JERRY: (accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?
JERRY: I told you, forget it.
JERRY: You're robbing me.
JERRY: (removing his coat) So? 
JERRY: Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this?
JERRY: Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? 
JERRY: Yeah?
JERRY: Come on up.
JERRY: No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.
JERRY: It's the obligation, you know? 
JERRY: Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.
JERRY: (muffled) Hi Wendy.
JERRY: (muffled) Would you like something to drink?
JERRY: (muffled) There you go.
JERRY: Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.
JERRY: So, how's everything going?
JERRY: Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.
JERRY: C'mon, that's not fair!
JERRY: No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture.
JERRY: (throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?
JERRY: Oh my god! 
JERRY: ...You can't put that picture up.
JERRY: Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary.
JERRY: (not really) Yeah.
JERRY: Oh, sure, yeah.
JERRY: Oh, no!
JERRY: You see? 
JERRY: What is so funny?
JERRY: Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? 
JERRY: (aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!
JERRY: (suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.
JERRY: (not as eager) Hi Joan.
JERRY: Pretty good.
JERRY: Okay, great.
JERRY: Oh, I'm delighted.
JERRY: You too.
JERRY: Hi, Louise.
JERRY: Ah, well. Thank you very much!
JERRY: (agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! 
JERRY: Family?
JERRY: You think I want another family? 
JERRY: Yes, it's very strange. Very strange.
JERRY: I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that.
JERRY: You should have her work on it for you.
JERRY: Hi Mary.
JERRY: Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....
JERRY: ...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.
JERRY: Hi Louise...
JERRY: ...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry.
JERRY: (as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.
JERRY: Hello.
JERRY: Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? 
JERRY: Okay, I will.
JERRY: (locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.
JERRY: Hey, Kramer, look at this.
JERRY: Look at my picture!
JERRY: I've been defaced!
JERRY: Hi Jack.
JERRY: Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, You think?
JERRY: (defensive) No no, that's not true!
JERRY: You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.
JERRY: Buddy?
JERRY: So you were with him that day at the track?
JERRY: Leo?
JERRY: Is that so?
JERRY: Well, that's very interesting.
JERRY: (standing) Uncle Leo! 
JERRY: (with a triumphant point) You're busted!
JERRY: Hey, Steve. How you doing?
JERRY: Hey, Jeff. What's happening?
JERRY: Mary! 
JERRY: Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!
JERRY: Oh, Paul, could you hold that door...
JERRY: Hey. Could I use your shower?
JERRY: (pleading) I got a date. C'mon, please.
JERRY: (impressed) Who's that?
JERRY: Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.
JERRY: (rueful acceptance) Oh, yeah, I understand.
JERRY: (indicates with his thumb) Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.
JERRY: Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Can I just go up?
JERRY: How 'bout those Knicks?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.
JERRY: The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off?
JERRY: Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?
JERRY: We'll still make the movie.
JERRY: Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.
JERRY: (picks up phone) Hello? 
JERRY: Alright, he just left. We can go.
JERRY: (surprise) You? 
JERRY: So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building?
JERRY: Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye.
JERRY: Yeah, and?
JERRY: What d'you mean, breasts?
JERRY: So what? 
JERRY: But, your father's not bald.
JERRY: Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.
JERRY: Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?
JERRY: Yes, we do.
JERRY: He's... trying to get something off his chest.
JERRY: (jumps in surprise) Hoh! 
JERRY: (trying to ease the tension) Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends.
JERRY: I'd like to be.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Wha...? 
JERRY: Oh.
JERRY: (to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! 
JERRY: Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?
JERRY: (after the guy) You think you're better than me?
JERRY: Oh, right.
JERRY: (dismissive) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
JERRY: He left me there. You see the mind games?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: He asked me to. We were getting along.
JERRY: Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? 
JERRY: Alright, well what if we say...
JERRY: I came to pick you up.
JERRY: I know. I was just...
JERRY: Alright, well. Just, start again, then.
JERRY: Right.
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.
JERRY: But I don't know if this is gonna work.
JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: You're saying I'm responsible for the couch?
JERRY: (livid) Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one!
JERRY: I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.
JERRY: It's hardly been used.
JERRY: Poppie!
JERRY: What're you doing here?
JERRY: Ohh. Hey, how you feeling?
JERRY: Hmm.
JERRY: No, Poppie! 
JERRY: "Jimmy"
JERRY: "I dunno how you could forget . He kept reffering to himself in the third person. "Jimmy's under the boards. Jimmy's in the open. Jimmy makes the shot."
JERRY: "Why. 
JERRY: "No...Got dental appointment."
JERRY: "Oh! 
JERRY: "I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery."
JERRY: "All right."
JERRY: "They get all emotional , they sway. 
JERRY: "I don't think so."
JERRY: "No... 
JERRY: "No ,Elaine and I we're just discussing whether I could admit a man is attractive."
JERRY: "Just one....gotta go back.....Oh but get this. Elaine, you will appreciate this. 
JERRY: "Of course.... But that's got nothing to do with it."
JERRY: "What are you doing that for, you got a job"
JERRY: " Yeah! 
JERRY: "Jimmy's got a record. Jimmy's jumping for dollars. Jimmt and George are gonna get rich."
JERRY: "Ahh! 
JERRY: "Looks like he gave you some Novocaine"
JERRY: "So what about the Penthouse. 
JERRY: "You find you need to use a lot of obscenities at the dentist.
JERRY: "Hey! 
JERRY: "Well...........you know....."
JERRY: "Not necessarily because....."
JERRY: "Oh! 
JERRY: "I don't think so. 
JERRY: "You know! 
JERRY: "Sometimes I tuck'em sometimes I don't"
JERRY: "I don't think I'm hungry:"
JERRY: "Jimmy?
JERRY: "I dunno. 
JERRY: "Did you notice he always refer to himself in the third person. Jimmy can dunk. Jimmy's new in town. Jimmy we'll see you later."
JERRY: "That's Jimmy. 
JERRY: "Jimmy's gonna put the moves on Elaine.."
JERRY: "No no you said George likes spicy chicken."
JERRY: "Where's my Mr. 
JERRY: (cuts in) A nude model. 
JERRY: You know I went out once with a nude model. Never let me see her naked. Hundreds of people see her naked every week, except me. Needless to say it was quite vexing. 
JERRY: Yeah! 
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Soo... 
JERRY: No ,no I don't, I mean, Don't be silly.. 
JERRY: It's just... 
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: Yeah, but with you it's intentional. 
JERRY: Yeah, but this is different , this is like ,you know, semi digested food stuff. You know the next stop is the stomach and you can take it from there. 
JERRY: AH. Yes that's gonna make a big difference. 
JERRY: Hey ,You think that Shelly's upset that I made such a big deal about the pecan. 
JERRY: Thanks. 
JERRY: Ah! 
JERRY: Yeah! 
JERRY: Yeah! 
JERRY: It's just a drawing. 
JERRY: the usual 
JERRY: Good for you 
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town. 
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: Don't ask. 
JERRY: No ,it's George ( Elaine laughs heartily) 
JERRY: You know my parents are coming in and I got some clean up to do , so if you and Potsie are done scheming.... 
JERRY: What's in? 
JERRY: Aah! 
JERRY: Nah, I don't wanna 
JERRY: I don't want it.. 
JERRY: I DON'T WANT IT .... 
JERRY: I am not gonna taste your peach. I ate some one's pecan last night, I'm not gonna eat your peach. 
JERRY: ..What is this? 
JERRY: Yeah! 
JERRY: Look at this, my ankle's all bitten up. 
JERRY: No. 
JERRY: How could I have fleas? 
JERRY: What did you do about them? 
JERRY: Nothing... 
JERRY: Mom, Dad.....I have fleas.. 
JERRY: I don't get this. How did this happen. I don't have a dog. 
JERRY: I don't understand this.. 
JERRY: Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town. 
JERRY: Okay.. 
JERRY: I have fleas. 
JERRY: I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment for two days. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my parents. they'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own I'm sure it's gonna be some awful dump. Wait a second.. Have you checked in The Plaza yet? 
JERRY: Come on,c'mon 
JERRY: c'mon ,c'mon.... 
JERRY: c'mon, c'mon.... 
JERRY: I dunno , I'm gonna ask Shelley ,but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident. 
JERRY: Yeah.. When he's dead he'll be relieved... Oh by the way Viking Press sent a Fedex for you to my parents. They brought it with 'em. 
JERRY: You see the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around, but they don't know they're ugly, because nobody actually tells them. 
JERRY: I dunno... 
JERRY: That'd be the fleas. 
JERRY: Yeah! 
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: Yeah! 
JERRY: You see? 
JERRY: I told you to take it. 
JERRY: Well, You can't go in there it's like a gas chamber in there. 
JERRY: Kramer, they're fumigating. There's toxic gas in there. 
JERRY: Aw! 
JERRY: How do you feel? 
JERRY: Well wh..wh.what are you doing? 
JERRY: Didn't you see the sign on the door? 
JERRY: Can you get me a soda? 
JERRY: I don't know. Who could've been in my apartment. 
JERRY: Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers? 
JERRY: Let me see those. ( smells them) Oh! 
JERRY: Newman . Open the door, Newman, I know you're in there. 
JERRY: There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it.. 
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! 
JERRY: Hey, thanks a lot for lettin' me stay here. 
JERRY: ( embarrassed laugh) ...Oh! 
JERRY: I forgot my toothbrush. 
JERRY: (long pause).......Sure. ( humms a song then stares at the toothbrush) 
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: She's seen you in this thing. 
JERRY: And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins. 
JERRY: Ahh! 
JERRY: I wouldn't use her toothbrush. 
JERRY: Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog. 
JERRY: I hear you're going out with David Putty.
JERRY: Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.
JERRY: Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.
JERRY: The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Yeah, so.
JERRY: What move?
JERRY: Wait a second. *My* move?
JERRY: David Putty used *my* move?
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.
JERRY: Oh, it wasn't like that! 
JERRY: Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: No! 
JERRY: Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.
JERRY: Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.
JERRY: I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.
JERRY: ...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.
JERRY: Can I just get it opened first?
JERRY: All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar).
JERRY: You feel better?
JERRY: Nancy Klopper?
JERRY: All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---
JERRY: It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---
JERRY: All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? 
JERRY: Is it padded?
JERRY: Good. How tall is she?
JERRY: You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.
JERRY: George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.
JERRY: Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.
JERRY: I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: When did you do this?
JERRY: Oh... Why Fusilli?
JERRY: Well, thank you very much.
JERRY: Assman?
JERRY: Who would order a license plate that says "Assman"?
JERRY: It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.
JERRY: Yeah. Proctologist.
JERRY: I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.
JERRY: Hey, David.
JERRY: Hey, what's the story? 
JERRY: What move? 
JERRY: The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.
JERRY: Swirl.
JERRY: Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.
JERRY: You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? 
JERRY: Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.
JERRY: Fine.
JERRY: You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?
JERRY: Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.
JERRY: Yeah?
JERRY: C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? 
JERRY: Hello? 
JERRY: Except that it's not Putty.
JERRY: Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.
JERRY: Hey, Elaine.
JERRY: Is it something I said?
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: Huh.
JERRY: Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?
JERRY: You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.
JERRY: Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order)
JERRY: That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry.
JERRY: Yeah. Kramer made it.
JERRY: Hey, Assman!
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Sixteen hundred dollars? 
JERRY: Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.
JERRY: Are you kidding? 
JERRY: Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?
JERRY: I don't know. Why?
JERRY: What do you mean?
JERRY: Really, stopping short. That's a good move.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Oh, my god!
JERRY: If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.
JERRY: He had to use cork-screw pasta.
JERRY: Assman!
JERRY: What time does your flight get in? 
JERRY: Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours.
JERRY: I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.
JERRY: So that's it? 
JERRY: You're marchin' in.
JERRY: Hey. Elaine's quitting.
JERRY: How 'bout the march out?
JERRY: Get a march goin'! 
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: What for?
JERRY: Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
JERRY: Yes, I know. I've flown before.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: I don't care.
JERRY: Who?
JERRY: I don't care, why are you telling me this?
JERRY: Why would I freak out? 
JERRY: Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those orange cones you have on the throughway... (Sees pilot) on the way... up here... um... I..
JERRY: No, it didn't. And you know why? 
JERRY: If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.
JERRY: Oh, it doesn't matter now.
JERRY: Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!
JERRY: (To Katie) What is the complication?
JERRY: Yes?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: I didn't care.
JERRY: He can't just throw me off the plane!
JERRY: But I'm not a disturbance!
JERRY: But someone is waiting for me!
JERRY: I'm freakin' out! 
JERRY: Which one do you think I want?
JERRY: Then we'll make it the eight.
JERRY: Hotel?
JERRY: No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.
JERRY: I don't have a preference, okay! 
JERRY: George.
JERRY: I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club...
JERRY: Carl, I think.
JERRY: Yeah, he was nice.
JERRY: Defent.
JERRY: You need an exterminator?
JERRY: Oh, don't tell me. 'Cause he's black?
JERRY: George, George!
JERRY: Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?
JERRY: Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late.
JERRY: Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll never get another date with her. She'll freak out.
JERRY: I am a little freaked out!
JERRY: All right, but you have to go now.
JERRY: (Wakes up) Where are we?
JERRY: Is this even a road?
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: No, road is a major detail!
JERRY: (Pointing ahead) Look out!
JERRY: That's it! 
JERRY: Bridget!
JERRY: Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: What are you telling him for?
JERRY: He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?
JERRY: Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, "Hey, they like the soup! 
JERRY: Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg.
JERRY: John Houseman?
JERRY: Hi, Alec.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? 
JERRY: Oh, I'd love to, are you sure?
JERRY: Gee thanks! 
JERRY: Alright, thanks again.
JERRY: Really, thank you.
JERRY: Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? 
JERRY: These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you?
JERRY: They're the worst.
JERRY: Well, what is with you?
JERRY: Yeah, he's dating a crayon.
JERRY: Toilet paper?
JERRY: What are you talking about?
JERRY: Toilet paper's changed.
JERRY: It's softer.
JERRY: More sheets per roll
JERRY: Comes in a wide variety of colors.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?
JERRY: Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there.
JERRY: Well, so it wasn't a total loss.
JERRY: Hey, I forgot to tell you! 
JERRY: What about you, George?
JERRY: Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?
JERRY: Sure, fine with me.
JERRY: "I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat."
JERRY: Big matzoh ball.
JERRY: Those damn 'I love you' returns.
JERRY: Oh, you don't know.
JERRY: Unless you're married.
JERRY: No, people hate that.
JERRY: Ideally.
JERRY: No question about it.
JERRY: At the zoo?
JERRY: Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?
JERRY: It's a monkey, Kramer!
JERRY: Well, I still think it's wrong.
JERRY: I'm not taking anyone's side.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: What do I gotta call him for? 
JERRY: No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking.
JERRY: Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place.
JERRY: Ah, you're out of your mind.
JERRY: I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.
JERRY: Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?
JERRY: No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car.
JERRY: The one Puddy screamed at in the car?
JERRY: Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.
JERRY: Gotta support the team.
JERRY: Hm.
JERRY: Hm.
JERRY: Hm.
JERRY: (noticing Alec Berg walk in, whispers) Hey, Alec!
JERRY: Did you see that? 
JERRY: I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Well?
JERRY: Well, I don't think that's gonna happen.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Are you gonna say it again?
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: He's gonna talk into her other ear.
JERRY: Yeah, I saw him.
JERRY: Well, not exactly.
JERRY: I don't know if he's mad.
JERRY: Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.
JERRY: See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'.
JERRY: Look, what do you want me to do?
JERRY: No. No, I can't!
JERRY: Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets.
JERRY: Hello? 
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Alright! 
JERRY: Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night.
JERRY: Oh, you already gave them away?
JERRY: No, we don't care, we just want to go.
JERRY: (To himself) Now what am I supposed to do here? 
JERRY: She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was "Beaches" for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?
JERRY: I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.
JERRY: Of course.
JERRY: yeah,
JERRY: The Improv is playing "Rochelle Rochelle" The musical.
JERRY: She might be. She's the star of the show.
JERRY: Yeah, maybe.
JERRY: That's the understudy. I'm dating her.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say.
JERRY: Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? 
JERRY: How would you know? 
JERRY: Why don't you go to another nail shop?
JERRY: What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what they're saying.
JERRY: You know who speaks Korean?
JERRY: George's father.
JERRY: He used to go there a lot on business.
JERRY: He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, that were manufactured in Korea.
JERRY: George, does your father speak Korean?
JERRY: Oh, hi Gennice.
JERRY: This is George, this is Kramer.
JERRY: Playing today?
JERRY: They really stick to that understudy rule.
JERRY: It's okay…it's just a hot dog, (still sobbing) everything is going to be okay.
JERRY: Come on George, just loosen up.
JERRY: Come on George.
JERRY: (to George) Keep going.
JERRY: Well we…
JERRY: (with no emotion) It's okay. Everything is going to be all right.
JERRY: Come back another time.
JERRY: I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody up.
JERRY: Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy.
JERRY: Stop your crying will ya?
JERRY: Hey, I had nothing to do with it.
JERRY: We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: What happened?
JERRY: Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later.
JERRY: Where?
JERRY: (pushing her) How did you get that?
JERRY: You met J. Peterman?
JERRY: What is he like?
JERRY: (walking away) Yeah, I'll see ya'.
JERRY: Well, break a leg tonight.
JERRY: Listen buddy,
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: Oh, I'm so sorry.
JERRY: So you don't cry when your grandmother dies? 
JERRY: Good luck.
JERRY: And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? 
JERRY: Yeah, what else?
JERRY: Happy, Pappy? 
JERRY: Oh, you're "Pappy".
JERRY: Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?
JERRY: Hey, I got a real thing about "shushing"!
JERRY: Ahh.
JERRY: What is this? 
JERRY: We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these women.
JERRY: Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?
JERRY: We're pathetic… you know that?
JERRY: Why can't I be normal?
JERRY: It would be nice to care about someone.
JERRY: Hmm. I thought she became a lesbian.
JERRY: Oh.
JERRY: Hmm.
JERRY: See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think?
JERRY: Well, this is it. I'm really gonna do something about my life, you know? 
JERRY: I'm serious about it.
JERRY: I'm not kidding.
JERRY:'s. He's on the phone]
JERRY: Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity. 5? 
JERRY: I had a very interesting lunch with GEORGE: Costanza today.
JERRY: We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men.
JERRY: Yes. We did.
JERRY: There isn't?
JERRY: Well...
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: I can?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Boy.
JERRY: I'm glad we had this talk.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: You're going to rub out the dog?
JERRY: What, you're considering this?
JERRY: How come you're eating your peas one at a time?
JERRY: Hey!
JERRY: What are you up to?
JERRY: What's the rope for?
JERRY: The dog. You're getting the dog.
JERRY: Did what?
JERRY: You're getting married?
JERRY: Oh, my god!
JERRY: I'm blown away.
JERRY: Wow!
JERRY: And she said "Yes"?
JERRY: You're gonna have gorgeous kids.
JERRY: Pinkish hue?
JERRY: Well...actually, we kind of broke up.
JERRY: Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's got this strangest habit. She eats her peas one at a time. You've never seen anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. I mean, we've had dinner other times. I've seen her eat Corn Niblets. But she scooped them.
JERRY: Yes. That's what was so vexing.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married.
JERRY: You thought I was gonna get married?
JERRY: I mean, you love Susan, right?
JERRY: You want to spend the rest of your life with her
JERRY: So?
JERRY: No. So, we're still on to see uh, Firestorm tonight?
JERRY: I'll pick you up at your apartment. We'll go to the Eight.
JERRY: Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. ! 
JERRY: Yes, come on! 
JERRY: You know what? 
JERRY: Ready?
JERRY: Oh, how come?
JERRY: Well, she could come.
JERRY: Oh.
JERRY: Oh, The Muted Heart. Glen Close. Sally Field. Well, that should be good.
JERRY: Hey, wait a second. You know, we could share a cab. They're playing at the same Cineplex.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: How about when Harrison Ford jumped out of that plane, and he was shooting back at them as he was falling?
JERRY: Oh, man!
JERRY: What was that?
JERRY: Oh, Mattingly just singled .
JERRY: I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand.
JERRY: We come from the same place.
JERRY: Very strange.
JERRY: So, tell me anyway. Who was the BIG mastermind?
JERRY: All right. But then I can't tell you the BIG news.
JERRY: Sorry!
JERRY: All right, Elaine but this is beyond news. This is like Pearl Harbor. Or the Kennedy assassination. It's like not even news. It's total shock.
JERRY: George Costanza...
JERRY: Is getting married!
JERRY: Newman.
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
JERRY: That's great.
JERRY: That looks pretty good.
JERRY: Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.
JERRY: Come on! 
JERRY: Yeah, he seems pretty happy.
JERRY: What's the matter?
JERRY: Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.
JERRY: Well, at least have some reaction to it.
JERRY: Maybe you're a little jealous.
JERRY: No! 
JERRY: Oh, yeah. Right.
JERRY: Lainy!
JERRY: You don't wanna get married?
JERRY: Oh, come on!
JERRY: You're such...
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: We're gonna change the system.
JERRY: Hey!
JERRY: Have I ever been less than forthright?
JERRY: Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?
JERRY: Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.
JERRY: I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.
JERRY: Yes, I do.
JERRY: Hmm.
JERRY: See, now that I don't care for.
JERRY: It should resolve of its own volition.
JERRY: Momentum - same thing.
JERRY: Yeah, I know.
JERRY: You're turning.
JERRY: If you need more time, you should have more time.
JERRY: Sure you can. Why not?
JERRY: I don't see why not.
JERRY: Sure, go ahead.
JERRY: Spring. Of course.
JERRY: Beautiful.
JERRY: No, she's not.
JERRY: Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.
JERRY: Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.
JERRY: Oh, all the way.
JERRY: Is that so?
JERRY: Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?
JERRY: You're kidding?
JERRY: You would turn me in?
JERRY: I can't believe your a friend of mine.
JERRY: Well, I am sure I had a good reason.
JERRY: But you know me!
JERRY: So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.
JERRY: Another Café Latte?
JERRY: Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Café Latte?
JERRY: I don't recall you drinking Café Latte.
JERRY: Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.
JERRY: You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.
JERRY: Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.
JERRY: Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
JERRY: Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.
JERRY: I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.
JERRY: tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.
JERRY: Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.
JERRY: You didn't have make-up sex? 
JERRY: In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.
JERRY: . . . Poor bastard.
JERRY: Good evening, Rabbi.
JERRY: Well, Rabbi, well.
JERRY: Yeah, that's right.
JERRY: What do you mean?
JERRY: No.
JERRY: is that so?
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: I didn't know any of this.
JERRY: Hum, well it all comes as news to me.
JERRY: You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.
JERRY: Understand you had a little talk with him too.
JERRY: Yes I know, I know.
JERRY: Nothing, nothing.
JERRY: Yes he did.
JERRY: We had quite a little chat.
JERRY: Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.
JERRY: It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.
JERRY: He did it.
JERRY: That's what's so fascinating.
JERRY: You better finish your little café latte there. They won't let you in with it.
JERRY: Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
JERRY: That's the rule.
JERRY: Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me
JERRY: Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.
JERRY: No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? 
JERRY: Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? 
JERRY: What?
JERRY: You cried?
JERRY: Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.
JERRY: Suing? 
JERRY: It's supposed to be hot.
JERRY: Why would anyone eat canned fruit? 
JERRY: I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.
JERRY: Where you going?
JERRY: Discount?
JERRY: So ah, what did you do last night?
JERRY: I know nothing, but what did you actually do?
JERRY: Wow. That really is nothing.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: What are you all dressed up for?
JERRY: Oh yeah, how's that looking?
JERRY: Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.
JERRY: Hi Bob.
JERRY: (Apologetically) Oh, I'm sorry. Maestro.
JERRY: I hear it's ah beautiful there.
JERRY: (Surprised) Huh?
JERRY: This is a, Bob Cobb.
JERRY: Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?
JERRY: Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.
JERRY: Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
JERRY: Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.
JERRY: Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.
JERRY: New shirt?
JERRY: No, not particularly.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?
JERRY: (Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Are you sensing anything right now?
JERRY: Well, what about criminal activity? 
JERRY: Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
JERRY: I know you will.
JERRY: His lawyer.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Why are they settling?
JERRY: All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?
JERRY: What do you mean?
JERRY: So?
JERRY: I thought they wanted to settle.
JERRY: Then you're in a lot of trouble.
JERRY: Did you have a good time?
JERRY: (Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.
JERRY: So what about the "Maestro" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.
JERRY: You didn't mind?
JERRY: O.K. from now on I want you to call me "Jerry the Great".
JERRY: Why not you call him Maestro.
JERRY: Well, I'm great.
JERRY: What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?
JERRY: You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there.
JERRY: I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
JERRY: In all of Tuscany? 
JERRY: Hey you know we were just talking about you.
JERRY: Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?
JERRY: No. I'm not really looking.
JERRY: So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?
JERRY: I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?
JERRY: How'd you get yours?
JERRY: Maybe I'll check out France.
JERRY: Hey George, do you believe this guy?
JERRY: Bob Cobb.
JERRY: You know, the Maestro.
JERRY: Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.
JERRY: I have no idea.
JERRY: Oh, no way it's that big.
JERRY: Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?
JERRY: Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.
JERRY: Yeah and?
JERRY: So are you gonna get him a chair?
JERRY: Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without.
JERRY: Swivel?
JERRY: I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect.
JERRY: Yes.
JERRY: How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? 
JERRY: Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy.
JERRY: Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?
JERRY: That's it?
JERRY: You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.
JERRY: You're racing!
JERRY: Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio.
JERRY: Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio.
JERRY: Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?
JERRY: Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?
JERRY: I didn't actually want to rent it.
JERRY: So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was just wondering if there were houses there to rent.
JERRY: You didn't have to push me.
JERRY: 75,000 lira.
JERRY: Kramer you don't under the conversion rate.
JERRY: You know I don't even know why I brought you.
JERRY: Not bad!
JERRY: I don't know. Blind date?
JERRY: Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.
JERRY: I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.
JERRY: You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.
JERRY: Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.
JERRY: Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.
JERRY: A healthy person.
JERRY: Oh, sorry
JERRY: I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.
JERRY: You're going by sound? 
JERRY: Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?
JERRY: Twenty-five percent, you say? 
JERRY: Way off? 
JERRY: UNDATEABLE!
JERRY: Alcohol.
JERRY: Pulp couldn't make it across the table.
JERRY: Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.
JERRY: Hi,
JERRY: Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.
JERRY: Well, no, I'm not one of those.
JERRY: Grandma Memma?
JERRY: No, I think I would have remembered Memma.
JERRY: What do you recommend besides the steak?
JERRY: Anything lighter? 
JERRY: You know what? 
JERRY: (mind's voice) Just a salad? 
JERRY: Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?
JERRY: Did she mention anything about our lunch?
JERRY: What do you mean, "kind of."?
JERRY: What are you saying? 
JERRY: But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?
JERRY: What is she making?
JERRY: Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery.
JERRY: Um, mutton! 
JERRY: Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton.
JERRY: I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? 
JERRY: This is some FINE mutton.
JERRY: Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)
JERRY: What?
JERRY: I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?
JERRY: Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?
JERRY: Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! 
JERRY: Why were dogs chasing you?
JERRY: I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.
JERRY: Head to toe?
JERRY: I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.
JERRY: I'll make them later. Uh.
JERRY: It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.
JERRY: Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.
JERRY: Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.
JERRY: I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?
JERRY: You spent the night at James's? 
JERRY: Reversed positions?
JERRY: So what your genitals are still lined up.
JERRY: Yeah. Come on up.
JERRY: Hey. What's all this?
JERRY: I thought we were going out.
JERRY: Franco?
JERRY: I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
JERRY: That is so Franco.
JERRY: I usually like mine with an angioplasty.
JERRY: What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.
JERRY: We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.
JERRY: Hey, what happened to my jacket?
JERRY: Uh, sometimes I use the sofa.
JERRY: (to Elaine) I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog. (to George) Get this one: "I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest".
JERRY: I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.
JERRY: How do you pull that off?
JERRY: Yeah, he looks busy! 
JERRY: So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?
JERRY: What marathon runner?
JERRY: Oh, wait! 
JERRY: He's from uh...Trinidad and Tobago, right?
JERRY: How do you oversleep at the Olympics...?
JERRY: I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! 
JERRY: Ah...that's a big responsability on your hands.
JERRY: You gotta wake him up!
JERRY: I've seen her in your building.
JERRY: I didn't know she was married.
JERRY: Whom I gonna tell?
JERRY: He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?
JERRY: My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on. (Kramer enters with a bucket and starts filling it with water on the sink) Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.
JERRY: What do you do?
JERRY: Always works?
JERRY: Hot tub?
JERRY: Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?
JERRY: I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
JERRY: Ah, hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you.
JERRY: Sorry about the Olympics.
JERRY: Ah...catalog writer's block?
JERRY: (pause) So what happened? 
JERRY: AM/PM.
JERRY: Ah...the volume.
JERRY: Ah, separate knob.
JERRY: Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.
JERRY: Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.
JERRY: Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?
JERRY: It's a simple question...
JERRY: That old one? 
JERRY: Elaine...
JERRY: You're 40 minutes late. What happened?
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.
JERRY: Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!
JERRY: Yes I am.
JERRY: Yeah, I know that!
JERRY: I'm not talking about upside down. (Jean-Paul and Kramer come in) I'm talking about waking him up!
JERRY: Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? 
JERRY: What happened?
JERRY: Yeah. 
JERRY: Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! 
JERRY: I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.
JERRY: Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay... is uh...
JERRY: I'm saying "get the hell outta there"! 
JERRY: These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin' to make that call! 
JERRY: Hey, how was the meeting?
JERRY: Sons of bitches?
JERRY: How many sweaters you got on?
JERRY: Your core temperature?
JERRY: Turn up the heat in your apartment! 
JERRY: I got the call...!
JERRY: (stops walking) Jean-Paul! 
JERRY: Pretty lucky to find this hotel, Jean-Paul.
JERRY: All right. (picks up the alarm clock) Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 6:50... volume check. (music playing, he starts swinging) What kinda music you wanna wake up to? 
JERRY: How about adult contemporary?
JERRY: All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm away, gets phone) now... the failsafe. The wake-up guy... (dials)
JERRY: Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 6:50 AM tomorrow morning.
JERRY: That's room 419. 6:50 AM. Four...one...niner...
JERRY: I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.
JERRY: Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...
JERRY: ...Yeah I am, but I just...(man hangs-up)
JERRY: humm...
JERRY: I think I offended the wake-up guy...! 
JERRY: (gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!
JERRY: What if he doesn't call now out of spite?
JERRY: (pause) Not comfortable... (gets up again)
JERRY: Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.
JERRY: Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal right now. (covers Jean-Paul with a blanket)
JERRY: That wake-up guy was trouble! 
JERRY: (shouting) Man that thing is noisy!
JERRY: Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 6:30 and gimme a call.
JERRY: He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.
JERRY: Frankly, I'm a little concerned.
JERRY: 4:02? 
JERRY: Come on, just put your clothes on! 
JERRY: Make way! 
JERRY: All right, go, it's a race! 
JERRY: I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!
JERRY: Maybe you should check with the rabbi.
JERRY: Come on, let's go Jean-Paul!
JERRY: Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?
JERRY: You're a shmoopy!
JERRY: You're a shmoopy!
JERRY: Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?
JERRY: All right, then. I'll see you later.
JERRY: Bye shmoopy.
JERRY: No. We gotta go to the soup place.
JERRY: He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.
JERRY: You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.
JERRY: There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.
JERRY: He yells and you don't get your soup.
JERRY: Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
JERRY: All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.
JERRY: The main thing is to keep the line moving.
JERRY: Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.
JERRY: Elaine.
JERRY: Ar-moire.
JERRY: He gave you the nice face discount.
JERRY: What about the soup?
JERRY: [in French accent] Pardon.
JERRY: It's like this all the time.
JERRY: Oh, no. It is. Just be still.
JERRY: Hard to believe.
JERRY: Shhhhh! 
JERRY: Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.
JERRY: Medium crab bisque.
JERRY: Just forget it. Let it go.
JERRY: Oh, man. Ohh! 
JERRY: I gave you a taste. What do you want?
JERRY: I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!
JERRY: I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
JERRY: Hi shmoopy.
JERRY: You're a shmoopy!
JERRY: Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: Just like that?
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?
JERRY: Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.
JERRY: What are you gonna get?
JERRY: You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!
JERRY: Uh-oh.
JERRY: Do I know you?
JERRY: It was a bisque.
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: Have you tastes the soup?
JERRY: See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Oh, thanks.
JERRY: So, did these thieves want any money?
JERRY: They just wanted the armoire?
JERRY: Yeah?
JERRY: Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?
JERRY: I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something.
JERRY: Hello.
JERRY: Absolutely not.
JERRY: Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.
JERRY: Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?
JERRY: I don't know, but you look like you're happy.
JERRY: You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy.
JERRY: Is that so?
JERRY: Disgusting?
JERRY: Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: You're still with the pact?
JERRY: All I did was shake your hand.
JERRY: It was stupid of me.
JERRY: No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
JERRY: What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? 
JERRY: So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?
JERRY: Aw!
JERRY: Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila.
JERRY: Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?
JERRY: Well, we're changing the rules.
JERRY: What about you, shmoopy? 
JERRY: Yum yum little tuna fishy?
JERRY: I'm heading over to Elaine's.
JERRY: Those two?
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: Well, let's confront 'em.
JERRY: There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.
JERRY: Let's go.
JERRY: I don't know. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley..."
JERRY: Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?
JERRY: Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.
JERRY: Elaine, let the man make his soup!
JERRY: Well. Well.
JERRY: Hey, Susan, George.
JERRY: Oh, really?
JERRY: Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
JERRY: Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.
JERRY: Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.
JERRY: Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: Wha - wha - what's the matter?
JERRY: Well, where are you going?
JERRY: So why didn't you tell her the code?
JERRY: George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.
JERRY: So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?
JERRY: Actually, that's the definition of selfish.
JERRY: No one's ever asked. You want it? 
JERRY: Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.
JERRY: What if my life depended on it?
JERRY: My foot fell asleep.
JERRY: I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.
JERRY: Hey Fred.
JERRY: My foot fell asleep.
JERRY: Fred, do you know Elaine?
JERRY: Seeya.
JERRY: So?
JERRY: And he didn't remember you?
JERRY: Where are you going, you just got here?
JERRY: Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun.
JERRY: Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? 
JERRY: What is that?
JERRY: Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.
JERRY: You're lucky they let you drive a car.
JERRY: (waving his arm in dismissal) Eh.
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: Well, what's to be said? 
JERRY: I know.
JERRY: Yeah, I know.
JERRY: Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
JERRY: Why would I wanna do that?
JERRY: Yeah, sounds like fun.
JERRY: Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our prices, we'll give you the store.
JERRY: No I don't.
JERRY: (to himself) My foot's asleep again!
JERRY: You know what? 
JERRY: Larry, wait, you don't understand!
JERRY: I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.
JERRY: Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it.
JERRY: Yup.
JERRY: Wow, the whole building burned down.
JERRY: Of course.
JERRY: The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.
JERRY: We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.
JERRY: Of course not, if I did would you have gone?
JERRY: There you go.
JERRY: Trust me, you're off.
JERRY: ...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code.
JERRY: They're closed.
JERRY: Bomb threat.
JERRY: Midnight Express, my friend.
JERRY: Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.
JERRY: Well, is Elaine here?
JERRY: Without Elaine? 
JERRY: We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.
JERRY: George, what's the matter with you?
JERRY: Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry.
JERRY: I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.
JERRY: Fred?
JERRY: You see what's going on here? 
JERRY: That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.
JERRY: Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there.
JERRY: Nah, he didn't make it.
JERRY: I did not bail out on you.
JERRY: Why didn't you come up with your own?
JERRY: Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?
JERRY: Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?
JERRY: Fire station?
JERRY: Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.
JERRY: Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.
JERRY: No I didn't.
JERRY: Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.
JERRY: Oh sure.
JERRY: Uh, again? 
JERRY: Beats me.
JERRY: Kramer?
JERRY: Ah, that's a shame.
JERRY: Oh my god. Look at this.
JERRY: It's the new J. Peterman catalog. Look.
JERRY: Well, what do you mean?
JERRY: Well I think that's pretty obvious.
JERRY: Hey Elaine.
JERRY: Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here. (pointing up and down at George)
JERRY: Mona a Baldo .
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: Hmm.
JERRY: I’m sorry.
JERRY: Ah, how about 8:30?
JERRY: You want to get something to eat first?
JERRY: Hey, why don't cha ask Susan?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: How come?
JERRY: Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined.
JERRY: No what?
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: Ahh.
JERRY: OK, see you later.
JERRY: Yeah. (Kramer sits in the seat next to Jerry) Uh, uh, oh, oh, Over there. (points to the next seat over)
JERRY: Little buffer zone.
JERRY: Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other?
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: What are you doing?
JERRY: Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.
JERRY: Pretend it's interesting.
JERRY: That's shocking, but sounds ...
JERRY: Oh, hey Ramon.
JERRY: Oh, no thanks. (turns back to Kramer)
JERRY: No.
JERRY: And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now.
JERRY: No why?
JERRY: Oh yeah, I know.
JERRY: Well it was my idea.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: She was looking for someone to go to the show with.
JERRY: World's collide. (points at George)
JERRY: Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact with --
JERRY: I didn’t know. Kramer told me about the worlds.
JERRY: Yeah, I guess I slipped up.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: What is it?
JERRY: 555-3455.
JERRY: (picks up the phone on the coffee table) “555-3455.” Well wait a second, don't you see that's 555-FILK.
JERRY: Filk’s nothing, but 555-FILM is Movie Phone.
JERRY: Yes, so people are just dialing it by mistake and getting you.
JERRY: You're Filk.
JERRY: Oh, well, I didn’t actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into him there. (putting on coat)
JERRY: All right, I gotta go.
JERRY: What else did you two do?
JERRY: Ah, so, ah, flower shows and, shopping for pretty bows, and then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight?
JERRY: Yes, I do. (very serious)
JERRY: Hey you know George isn't to happy, ahh, about your new friendship.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: You're looking up movies for people now?
JERRY: (shaking his head no) No Kramer I don't want to talk to him.
JERRY: Oh that's George. (presses the intercom button) Yeah?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: (to Ramon) Oh. Okay. (to Elaine) Wh, what is he doing here?
JERRY: He's the pool guy.
JERRY: Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here.
JERRY: Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.
JERRY: Hey. So, ah, Ramon this is my friend Elaine.
JERRY: So, ah, what are you doing around here Ramon?
JERRY: Ah, actually, I ka, kinda had some things to do.
JERRY: Ah, just, you know, I don't know. Stuff, I gotta do. (grabs coat and throws it over his shoulder)
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: All right Ramon, I’m going to get going.
JERRY: I think we should separate here actually.
JERRY: Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more.
JERRY: That has nothing to do with it.
JERRY: I, I love that George.
JERRY: So you want to catch a movie later?
JERRY: I don't have a paper though.
JERRY: Ramon, what are you doing here? 
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Look Ramon, about the other day. I’m sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway.
JERRY: What happened to all the towels?
JERRY: It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ...
JERRY: And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone.
JERRY: Tell me about it.
JERRY: You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
JERRY: I’m meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.
JERRY: Ah, you know. I’m supposed to meet, eh, someone -- I’ll, I’ll wait for them outside. (walks towards the door)
JERRY: This is gonna to be ugly. (quietly)
JERRY: (coughing) I said, boy am I ugly.
JERRY: We'll pull up another chair.
JERRY: I see you there Ramon.
JERRY: Hey, l‘ll just keep swimming. Hey, hey. I’m not done. I know what you're up to Ramon. Because I’m a member here, this is my place to swim.
JERRY: Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it.
JERRY: I think he's gonna need, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Well? 
JERRY: You knocked him out.
JERRY: Come on Newman. Do it.
JERRY: He might die.
JERRY: So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouth-to-mouth.
JERRY: Yeah, it was a gamble.
JERRY: Ah. (makes face)
JERRY: Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know, we can't go anywhere near there.
JERRY: I can't figure out what's going on here. I can't follow the plot. Why did they kill that guy? 
JERRY: What is he doing in the Chunnel?
JERRY: Wha’d you think Susan?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: You're cut off, you're out of the loop!
JERRY: You leave me no choice! 
JERRY: If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?
JERRY: I don't know, George.
JERRY: You know what? 
JERRY: No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.
JERRY: She's too good.
JERRY: I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!
JERRY: I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.
JERRY: No depravity! 
JERRY: I thought you said it was imminent.
JERRY: Sponge-worthy?
JERRY: But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime.
JERRY: Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person -
JERRY: Oh, o.k. (Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.)
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Oh...
JERRY: Tell you something...I do.
JERRY: Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing?
JERRY: I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. (Lena is puzzled.)
JERRY: It completely turned her off.
JERRY: I don't wanna be a 32.
JERRY: She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
JERRY: It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
JERRY: Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! 
JERRY: Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. (Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks at Kramer.)
JERRY: Who?
JERRY: Ruthie Cohen?
JERRY: Sure.
JERRY: Maybe that's why she's happy.
JERRY: What is this?
JERRY: That stinky old movie-house?
JERRY: Geoffrey who?
JERRY: I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.
JERRY: Oh, then I'm not worried.
JERRY: Lloyd.
JERRY: (peering) That's an interesting package.
JERRY: (chewing) Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?
JERRY: Nah, don't bother.
JERRY: I don't want it.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y. (he spits it into the waste bin)
JERRY: It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me.
JERRY: You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.
JERRY: And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.
JERRY: Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?
JERRY: I thought your parents were outta town?
JERRY: Oh, can Lloyd really do that?
JERRY: We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?
JERRY: Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable.
JERRY: I don't know what I was thinking.
JERRY: (noncommittal) Errh.
JERRY: (taking them) Well, what's this for?
JERRY: So what?
JERRY: Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.
JERRY: Ah, Lloyd.
JERRY: (unenthusiastic) Oh, the gum.
JERRY: (still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)
JERRY: Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.
JERRY: 's not necessary.
JERRY: I know that, Kramer.
JERRY: Yes I do, Kramer.
JERRY: I didn't see anything.
JERRY: So you say she was on a horse?
JERRY: Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips.
JERRY: Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue.
JERRY: I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.
JERRY: Maybe it's in the lost and found.
JERRY: You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.
JERRY: Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?
JERRY: Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: Aw, these are really strong glasses.
JERRY: (lacking enthusiasm) Yeah, yeah.
JERRY: Absolutely. Let's just stick around.
JERRY: Lloyd?
JERRY: Lloyd?
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: (handing it over) Here.
JERRY: (indistinct) Got all this?
JERRY: It's a lotta gum!
JERRY: Maybe he'll write a song about you.
JERRY: So I take it he's spongeworthy?
JERRY: Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.
JERRY: Oh, no?
JERRY: Come on. Come on.
JERRY: Elaine, you're among friends.
JERRY: Oh.
JERRY: Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?
JERRY: Sure. Why not? 
JERRY: But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.
JERRY: What stuff?
JERRY: All right. What are you, outta your mind? 
JERRY: A four-pound can of black olives? 
JERRY: A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? 
JERRY: Look...look at this can of tuna!
JERRY: This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: John Germaine? 
JERRY: Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy.
JERRY: Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in your friend John Germaine's band there.
JERRY: Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Oh
JERRY: Well, Clyde might not tell him.
JERRY: I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
JERRY: He stole back the rye?
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: So, do the Ross's know?
JERRY: Why wouldn't they be? 
JERRY: Bad situation.
JERRY: What do you mean replace it?
JERRY: Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?
JERRY: All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! 
JERRY: Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.
JERRY: Are you kidding? 
JERRY: What about Susan?
JERRY: Beautiful!
JERRY: What the hell are you doing there?
JERRY: No. No thanks.
JERRY: Just put it under your shirt.
JERRY: I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave.
JERRY: So, you think Clyde told him?
JERRY: Well, maybe it's a good thing.
JERRY: No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.
JERRY: No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.
JERRY: Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?
JERRY: There's none left?
JERRY: Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may depend on it.
JERRY: Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to give it up.
JERRY: All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you double what you paid for it.
JERRY: All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now, be reasonable you cannot turn down $50 for a $6 rye.
JERRY: Give me that rye!
JERRY: I want that rye, lady!
JERRY: Shut up, you old bag!
JERRY: How much did you give him?
JERRY: Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't get any oxygen.
JERRY: (grunting as he throws bread into the air)
JERRY: Wait a second! 
JERRY: How did you lock your keys in the car?
JERRY: So why don't you get a locksmith?
JERRY: How long has your car been sitting in the Yankee parking lot?
JERRY: Y- you're not playin' golf?
JERRY: Really, you're getting that good?
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Yeah, we'll see ya.
JERRY: (together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards)  Stan The Caddy.
JERRY: That's a hell of an organization they're running up there.  I can't understand why they haven't won a pennant in 15 years.
JERRY: Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Yeah, what happened?
JERRY: Sue Ellen Mishke? 
JERRY: Sounds familiar.
JERRY: Oh, yeah, you mentioned her.
JERRY: That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no--
JERRY: It's wrong, it's rude, and it's incorrect.
JERRY: We're only kidding!
JERRY: What are you going to get her?
JERRY: There's nothing subtle about that.
JERRY: Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?
JERRY: So, you're just taking off from work?
JERRY: Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the verge of this big promotion?
JERRY: What's goin' on?
JERRY: Yeah, so?
JERRY: Hey, what are ya up to?
JERRY: You wanna go with me up to (clap) the Bronx and see if there's any flyers on George's car.
JERRY: I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I? 
JERRY: Oh, man, look at this mess! 
JERRY: What are we gonna do?
JERRY: Well, we gotta get it washed (pulls off a few flyers)....Ah, the keys are locked inside!
JERRY: What are ya gonna do?
JERRY: Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?
JERRY: Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?
JERRY: I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it.
JERRY: He was starin' at some woman!
JERRY: There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing *just* a bra.  I can't get that image out of my mind.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Yeah!
JERRY: Sue Ellen Mishke?
JERRY: No, I don't.
JERRY: Is there, something I can help you with?
JERRY: Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.
JERRY: No, no, not at all.
JERRY: I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY: I don't know…
JERRY: …so the woman was walking around in a bra…
JERRY: … I mean it's no big deal. You're still drivin'. You should have been watching the road.  
JERRY: I don't think my attitude has changed.
JERRY: (quietly, yet in a high and whiney tone) Well, I don't know if I....
JERRY: Kramer I don't think I can--
JERRY: Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer.
JERRY: Nothing's happened.
JERRY: Oh, no, no, no, wait a second, wait a second… th-th-that--
JERRY: Kramer, it is not what you think.
JERRY: I just got the most bizarre message from you father, Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!
JERRY: Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a, it’s a little crumpled.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!
JERRY: Well you gotta call your parents.
JERRY: Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?
JERRY: I don't know.  Maybe.
JERRY: And she was beautiful in that bra! 
JERRY: Awright.
JERRY: What's even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics.
JERRY: I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck.
JERRY: Oh yeah.
JERRY: Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
JERRY: Seven? 
JERRY: Awright, let's see. How about Mug? 
JERRY: I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? 
JERRY: Oh, I forgot to call Christie.
JERRY: Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.
JERRY: (smug) I'm not engaged.
JERRY: Got what?
JERRY: Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.
JERRY: Sort of a mooching inventory.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.
JERRY: Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city.
JERRY: The exact same outfit.
JERRY: Three.
JERRY: Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?
JERRY: Why? 
JERRY: Indeed.
JERRY: Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.
JERRY: Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?
JERRY: You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't destroy someone else's.
JERRY: How about 'Mickey'?
JERRY: (holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the fridge?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: You cannot buy half a can of soda.
JERRY: Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?
JERRY: That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this, okay...
JERRY: ...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana...
JERRY: ...You bite it, you bought it.
JERRY: Thank you.
JERRY: Hey
JERRY: Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
JERRY: Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.
JERRY: You saw her? 
JERRY: Didn't you get a glimpse? 
JERRY: Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
JERRY: Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.
JERRY: Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind.
JERRY: No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sure you do.
JERRY: Oh.
JERRY: Change? 
JERRY: (looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
JERRY: Yes, change. By all means, change.
JERRY: What're you doing? 
JERRY: No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.
JERRY: You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.
JERRY: You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
JERRY: (pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you lay it out on the bed.
JERRY: Hello, Christie? 
JERRY: Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.
JERRY: I know. Pretty steep.
JERRY: Few do.
JERRY: Yeah, well, until this bill is paid...
JERRY: ...the food court is closed.
JERRY: Oh, I'm back, baby.
JERRY: Great. One of the best jobs I ever had.
JERRY: I killed.
JERRY: (taking off his jacket) Slaughtered. Wiped the floor with 'em and (hanging up jacket) not only that, the money was unbelievable.
JERRY: Yeah. Highest paying job I ever had.
JERRY: (reluctant) Nah, nah. I'd rather...
JERRY: Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship.
JERRY: And I'm always impressed.
JERRY: Awright, fine. You wanna see it?
JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: Here, check that out.
JERRY: I told you.
JERRY: (taking back the check) Oh yeah.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: I never shoulda told you.
JERRY: No, I can't feel anything.
JERRY: Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity.
JERRY: (deadpan) No.
JERRY: No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car.
JERRY: Maybe a Cadillac.
JERRY: Yeah. (thinking) That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. (decisive) I'm gonna do it.
JERRY: Oh, isn't that what it's all about?
JERRY: I want this baby fully loaded. (listens) Well, how soon can you get it there? 
JERRY: Hey, guess what. I just bought my father a Cadillac
JERRY: Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him.
JERRY: (joyless) Yeah, yes.
JERRY: The actress?
JERRY: Oh yeah.
JERRY: Yeah?
JERRY: Marisa Tomei?
JERRY: How does she know Marisa Tomei?
JERRY: You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I would've asked her.
JERRY: What d'you mean, could've?
JERRY: Ohh!
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: You know, she won an academy award?
JERRY: Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.
JERRY: Katherine Hepburn? 
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
JERRY: You like full lips.
JERRY: Mmm-mmm. Too bad you're engaged.
JERRY: (about the pie) This is no good.
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Sure.
JERRY: (about the cable guy) Nice people.
JERRY: Well, what about Susan?
JERRY: Would you tell Susan about it?
JERRY: Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.
JERRY: Hey, cable guy's looking for you.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out.
JERRY: You don't seem too bothered by it.
JERRY: Boy, I've never seen you like this.
JERRY: And, best of all, it's a Cadillac.
JERRY: Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.
JERRY: Ah, it's just money.
JERRY: Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?
JERRY: Are you okay?
JERRY: What was that?
JERRY: I notice you threw 'stocky' in there.
JERRY: Uhm, hold, hold on a second. (pauses counting) I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.
JERRY: Oh, right.
JERRY: No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car.
JERRY: Maybe I'll let you pick me up.
JERRY: Surprise!
JERRY: I'm a good son.
JERRY: Just like that.
JERRY: You wanna know? 
JERRY: C'mon, c'mon.
JERRY: Well, what d'you think?
JERRY: I bought it for you. It's yours.
JERRY: I bought you a Cadillac. (hands over the keys) Here you go.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: How d'you know?
JERRY: Why can't I buy my father a car?
JERRY: (under his breath) Well, this worked out just as I had hoped.
JERRY: That's what I was thinking.
JERRY: Hiya, Jack.
JERRY: That's right. I bought it.
JERRY: He doesn't wanna take a ride.
JERRY: Aahh!
JERRY: Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? 
JERRY: You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!
JERRY: Oh, hi Evelyn.
JERRY: Who's she?
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: Elaine? 
JERRY: (a little confused) You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables?
JERRY: Gee, I dunno what to tell you.
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Uh, I don't think so.
JERRY: I'll be back on Monday.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Alright, I'll see you.
JERRY: (putting the phone back to his ear) Yeah.
JERRY: Bye.
JERRY: Shut up, you old bag!
JERRY: Nice to meet you.
JERRY: Yeah, there's some sickos out there.
JERRY: You ever go to Camp Tiyoga?
JERRY: (opening the door) Well, it was nice meeting you.
JERRY: Ah, I think I'll go.
JERRY: (confused) Dinner? 
JERRY: (bewildered) Four-thirty? 
JERRY: I don't understand why we have to eat now.
JERRY: Can't we eat at a decent hour? 
JERRY: (emphatic) I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!
JERRY: Jack.
JERRY: Hi Doris.
JERRY: Awright, let's eat already.
JERRY: Shut up, you old bag!
JERRY: The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.
JERRY: Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?
JERRY: Yeah, sure. My parents will be there.
JERRY: Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?
JERRY: No.
JERRY: No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.
JERRY: Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.
JERRY: Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.
JERRY: No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.
JERRY: Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.
JERRY: (answering phone) Hello?
JERRY: You gotta be there at 4:30.
JERRY: Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 11:30.
JERRY: 30 years.
JERRY: All right, I'll see you later.
JERRY: Yeah, it is.
JERRY: No economic reason for them to be here.
JERRY: No social reason for them to be here.
JERRY: I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?
JERRY: You know Dad just called me.
JERRY: Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.
JERRY: All right, bye. (to Elaine): You see this? 
JERRY: I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! 
JERRY: The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.
JERRY: (to himself) Once a week? 
JERRY: I don't know how you do it.
JERRY: A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business.
JERRY: Well...
JERRY: Hey, it happens.
JERRY: He has no idea who you are.
JERRY: All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? 
JERRY: Well, keep looking.
JERRY: Yeah!
JERRY: Me either.
JERRY: You? 
JERRY: Where are you going?
JERRY: There's more food down the hall.
JERRY: Oh, hi.
JERRY: Actually, I'm drunk.
JERRY: I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.
JERRY: Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia, watching Jerry on TV. Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? 
JERRY: Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? 
JERRY: Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?
JERRY: Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?
JERRY: No good?
JERRY: Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?
JERRY: (offering a plate) Chicken?
JERRY: Poppy seeds!
JERRY: Hello Newman.
JERRY: Not from the footage I've seen.
JERRY: What's going on?
JERRY: Are you kidding?
JERRY: Where are they moving to?
JERRY: Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!
JERRY: We could visit together!
JERRY: That's incredible!
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: To spite my parents?
JERRY: Your parents are crazy!
JERRY: My parents are moving back too!
JERRY: You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.
JERRY: Hello.
JERRY: Oh, hi dad.
JERRY: Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?
JERRY: But it's a big complex.
JERRY: All right, fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone)
JERRY: They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.
JERRY: Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! 
JERRY: You know what you're doing, don't you? 
JERRY: C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody.
JERRY: Swinging? 
JERRY: Can you blame her?
JERRY: What do you recommend?
JERRY: Well, it's been a great visit.
JERRY: Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George.
JERRY: You have no idea.
JERRY: Thank you! 
JERRY: (Trying to ward her off) Hey. Hey!
JERRY: Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?
JERRY: (Modest) Oh, thanks.
JERRY: (Blunt) I believe you.
JERRY: (Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.
JERRY: Oh?
JERRY: Uh-huh.
JERRY: Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.
JERRY: Oh, okay..
JERRY: Ohh.. look at this..
JERRY: I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
JERRY: I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
JERRY: No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.
JERRY: I'm out.
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Thanks for the tip.
JERRY: Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.
JERRY: (Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing?
JERRY: (Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
JERRY: Like what?
JERRY: (Confused) Where's the punchline?
JERRY: A door mat? 
JERRY: Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.
JERRY: Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!
JERRY: Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? 
JERRY: Uh.. one of the three tenors.
JERRY: Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..
JERRY: (Nodding) Yeah, the other guy.
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: Why not?
JERRY: Hey, you look awful.
JERRY: Problem in the bedroom?
JERRY: Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?
JERRY: I thought you didn't want the doormat.
JERRY: Sally? 
JERRY: Excited? 
JERRY: It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
JERRY: (While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
JERRY: (Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! 
JERRY: Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.
JERRY: Why don't you just get rid of it?
JERRY: Wait, where are you going? 
JERRY: I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that? 
JERRY: Oh. (Intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it) Yeah?
JERRY: Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?
JERRY: (Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?
JERRY: How come? 
JERRY: I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?
JERRY: (Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? 
JERRY: Come in.
JERRY: Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.
JERRY: How was your flight? 
JERRY: (Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!
JERRY: (Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!
JERRY: I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! 
JERRY: (Peeved) I don't have any material!
JERRY: (Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! 
JERRY: Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.
JERRY: (Deeply sarcastic) No. You're never here.
JERRY: Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? 
JERRY: Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.
JERRY: Hello, Susan? 
JERRY: (Disappointed) Oh. Is George there?
JERRY: Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.
JERRY: (Obviously resents talking to her) Yes.
JERRY: Hey!
JERRY: Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy.
JERRY: (Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled "Ori-dent") Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!
JERRY: Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.
JERRY: Well, I want to sit down.
JERRY: It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. 
JERRY: (Surprised to see her, he gets up) Where's George?
JERRY: (Complaining) No! 
JERRY: (Slow whispering) This is a nightmare.
JERRY: My pants!
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Dead man walking.
JERRY: Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad.
JERRY: She did?
JERRY: So? 
JERRY: Beautiful.
JERRY: So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for membership.
JERRY: Catnap?
JERRY: (deadpan) That must be some book.
JERRY: Just imagine how much more you'll accomplish.
JERRY: I didn't know you had a hopper.
JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me.
JERRY: (downcast) Oh, I'm sorry.
JERRY: (jocular) You just bought your own dinner.
JERRY: (passing Hallie) 'Scuse me.
JERRY: Hey, not bad. (pointing to crest) I kinda like this little thing here.
JERRY: (to George) That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.
JERRY: (to George) I mean, come on. (a thought occurs) No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from *Seals and Croft*.
JERRY: Oh, come on.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: (looking at Kramer) This is nice.
JERRY: Morning?
JERRY: (looks at watch) Ten-thirty.
JERRY: (realising) Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. It belongs to the Friars Club.
JERRY: Breakfast?
JERRY: So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?
JERRY: What d'you call it?
JERRY: (deadpan) I think you need more sleep.
JERRY: So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?
JERRY: Oh, now you're being ridiculous.
JERRY: (indicates the bowl of cereal) No milk?
JERRY: (startled) Kramer!
JERRY: (confused) Wha..? 
JERRY: Well, what's wrong with you?
JERRY: No. Would you just get out?
JERRY: No!
JERRY: Ready for lunch?
JERRY: You think he's faking?
JERRY: That was him?
JERRY: Somehow I thought he'd be taller.
JERRY: (standing) Alright, I'll see you later.
JERRY: Hey, Bob.
JERRY: Bob.
JERRY: Hey, Bobby, over here.
JERRY: Bob. Oh, Bob.
JERRY: (louder) Bob!
JERRY: (urgent whisper) Elaine.
JERRY: I was just in the bathroom.
JERRY: No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy.
JERRY: No, I kinda tried to test his hearing.
JERRY: Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me.
JERRY: Well, he flinched, sort of.
JERRY: Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno.
JERRY: Actually, no.
JERRY: Right.
JERRY: Come in.
JERRY: That was something.
JERRY: (positive) Fantastic. Fantastic woman.
JERRY: I'm nuts about her.
JERRY: She could be an 'it'.
JERRY: She's got 'it' written all over her.
JERRY: Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.
JERRY: Whatever.
JERRY: That doesn't sound right.
JERRY: Flying Sandos. Beautiful.
JERRY: Walk me down to the Friars.
JERRY: It's not here.
JERRY: Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere.
JERRY: (to Kramer) Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night. (frustrated) Where the hell is that jacket?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Oh, well, that's at the cleaners.
JERRY: The cleaners? 
JERRY: (irritated) Great.
JERRY: Somehow? 
JERRY: Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.
JERRY: (to Kramer) Hey.
JERRY: Sorry, sorry I'm late.
JERRY: Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.
JERRY: Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.
JERRY: (smiling) I don't think so.
JERRY: My jacket?
JERRY: (giving in) Alright.
JERRY: Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just wanted to pick it up.
JERRY: (explaining) I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.
JERRY: Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.
JERRY: It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.
JERRY: (cynical) I'm sure it won't.
JERRY: (downcast) No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
JERRY: Yeah, we'll do it another time.
JERRY: (looking after the guys) That nut is always up to something.
JERRY: (into phone) Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. (to George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? 
JERRY: (worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? 
JERRY: (unenthusiastic) Uhh, I don't think so.
JERRY: (impassive) Ah, I'm a little turned off.
JERRY: Ahh, I'm, I'm kinda soured.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm soured.
JERRY: I'm sorry. I'm soured.
JERRY: Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket.
JERRY: (indifferent) Yeah, we'll see.
JERRY: I'll try and de-sour.
JERRY: (sharp) I'll try! 
JERRY: I still don't know what that means.
JERRY: (astonished) Oh god! 
JERRY: Who?
JERRY: What'd she do?
JERRY: (bewildered) Why would she try and kill you?
JERRY: Hey, there's uncle Milty.
JERRY: (pointing) And there's David Steinberg.
JERRY: The manager.
JERRY: (to George) Hey, there's Pat. (calls) Hey, Pat.
JERRY: I forgot to take it off.
JERRY: I'm sorry.
JERRY: Well, one of the gypsies took it.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: God, you're right.
JERRY: Well, I'm a prospective member.
JERRY: But that guy has my jacket.
JERRY: Come on.
JERRY: I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.
JERRY: Ouf.
JERRY: Hey. It's you! 
JERRY: (adamant) No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back.
JERRY: C'mon I need it.
JERRY: (determined) I wanna join. I need it to become a member.
JERRY: (examining) Hey George, you know what? 
JERRY: Yeah. (subdued) I don't think this is the jacket.
JERRY: Ohh, you got the jacket back.
JERRY: (taking the jacket) Thank you.
JERRY: Oh. (smiling) Oh, that's nice of 'em.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeahh.
JERRY: Maybe she'll sweeten.
JERRY: I'm looking for a crested blazer
JERRY: I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.
JERRY: (softly) Hmm.. they'll match my sneakers.
JERRY: You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.
JERRY: Really I'll be back.
JERRY: So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought.... And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me.
JERRY: Yeah..... He caught me So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend to look at the coat.
JERRY: Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.
JERRY: But if you go back with me , then I'm not.
JERRY: (to George) Problems with the house guest?
JERRY: Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.
JERRY: (proud of himself) Remember me? 
JERRY: Yeah.... well Elaine.
JERRY: (impatiently cutting in) Hey Elaine What about the crest.? 
JERRY: (giving up) Check.
JERRY: You weren't supposed to say that.
JERRY: That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice.
JERRY: And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?
JERRY: ...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're there approving new clothes.....That's a girlfriend job! 
JERRY: No I gave it back to you
JERRY: Forget it.
JERRY: He wont take ya..
JERRY: Hey! 
JERRY: Ah! 
JERRY: You know 'm just curious, How did you know she wasn't my girlfriend?
JERRY: Because you know we used to go out.
JERRY: Oh Yeah we went way out and wild.
JERRY: Hi Elaine.
JERRY: How do you know she's not my wife?
JERRY: Well, what about the ponytail?
JERRY: Of course he did ..The guy's working ya.
JERRY: Have you slept with him yet?
JERRY: It's been known to happen....... telling you right now Elaine, this guy 's gonna dangle that dress in front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule.
JERRY: (continues)Like a shrimp farmer....
JERRY: You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me. He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? 
JERRY: Turn in?
JERRY: It's only nine o clock.
JERRY: I can't go to sleep at nine o clock!
JERRY: Hey look ,you know, you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here. You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me.
JERRY: Oh why don't you go sleep over at Newman's.
JERRY: Well that's all I got.
JERRY: Huh?
JERRY: Kramer , there's no way you're sleeping with me.
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: Do I really have to explain why?
JERRY: Yeah Why?
JERRY: So ,Who is he?
JERRY: Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.
JERRY: ........For spite...
JERRY: That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.
JERRY: What do you mean?
JERRY: That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is.
JERRY: Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.
JERRY:. Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it
JERRY: But I changed my mind..
JERRY: OH! 
JERRY: Hey You're staying with my friend George.
JERRY: Well he doesn't even want himself there.
JERRY: All right. (sits down)
JERRY: They make wigs out of human hairs?
JERRY: Bye!
JERRY: ...Guess so.
JERRY: Hello..
JERRY: (Interrupts) Excuse me...Excuse me... Are you asking him out ?
JERRY: Well we're sitting here together. Why wouldn't you think that.
JERRY: Well it's very emasculating..
JERRY: What bet?
JERRY: So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?
JERRY: Huh.
JERRY: No. nothing.
JERRY: What's with you?
JERRY: Wow.That's hot.
JERRY: So know every time you get dressed. You are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer.
JERRY: I got a date with Nikki.
JERRY: She's also quite bold.
JERRY: Hey, Elaine.
JERRY: This is Nikki.
JERRY: Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? 
JERRY: Why don't you see what you can do?
JERRY: We'll see.
JERRY: Yeah. Why?
JERRY: Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding.
JERRY: Sure. If there cheap Why not.
JERRY: Told you.
JERRY: All right. Enjoy"Blame it on the Rain"
JERRY: There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.
JERRY: With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.
JERRY: So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.
JERRY: So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.
JERRY: She's like a beautiful Godzilla.
JERRY: What the hell is all this?
JERRY: Why can't you do this on your table?
JERRY: Hey. 
JERRY: You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends....
JERRY: Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.
JERRY: Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner
JERRY: Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.
JERRY: So what happened after the movie?
JERRY: To the door?
JERRY: That's a date.
JERRY: But I never walk you home.
JERRY: No, no.
JERRY: So how did you leave it with him?
JERRY: That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.
JERRY: Crazy like a man.
JERRY: I was got to be 55.
JERRY: A lot faster than that!
JERRY: Okay dokey
JERRY: Absolutely. Nikki!
JERRY: Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?
JERRY: You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.
JERRY: All right Nik. That's it.
JERRY: For both of us.
JERRY: What's wrong with your oven?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Come on up.
JERRY: I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!
JERRY: Peru! 
JERRY: I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.
JERRY: so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?
JERRY: Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?
JERRY: No. I never had a job.
JERRY: Kramer's cooking up some corduroy.
JERRY: What kind of pie are you cooking?
JERRY: I did.
JERRY: Well what could I do? 
JERRY: Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together.
JERRY: It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.
JERRY: I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.
JERRY: I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.
JERRY: I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no.
JERRY:What's that?
JERRY: Oh.
JERRY: Actually it's being taken care of right now.
JERRY: Okay, thank you. (hangs up the phone)
JERRY: They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.
JERRY: Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I?
JERRY: He's a very special maniac.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?
JERRY: Had I been taking...?
JERRY: W-well, what does it matter? 
JERRY: Not that I would think of doing such things.
JERRY: Well uh, whatever you can do. Thanks.
JERRY: I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.
JERRY: No. The police have no leads (sitting on the couch arm) and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.
JERRY: They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys.
JERRY: They're looking.
JERRY: Y'hello.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, okay. (to Elaine) They may have found the car.
JERRY: Are there golf clubs in the back?
JERRY: (indicating) This is Elaine Benes.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Well, what's going on? 
JERRY: Oh my God!
JERRY: What is that smell?
JERRY: Wait a second. Turbo? 
JERRY: No, it's a nine-hundred S. (happy) It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo!
JERRY: Hello.
JERRY: Tony, where are you?
JERRY: Tony, y-you better bring that car back!
JERRY: Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!
JERRY: Tony.
JERRY: (exasperated) Where do I find these guys?
JERRY: (answering phone) Y'hello.
JERRY: Why, what's up?
JERRY: Oh my god, you're kidding. (dives for his wallet) Hang on a second. (reading from his registration) It's JVN 728.
JERRY: Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.
JERRY: Good work Kramer, this is incredible.
JERRY: Yeah, it's me. Kramer found the car!
JERRY: It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.
JERRY: I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back.
JERRY: Last check-in, they were still on him.
JERRY: No, they won't call the police.
JERRY: They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record.
JERRY: Not a Federal record.
JERRY: Kramer?
JERRY: What's going on?

JERRY: Why not?
JERRY: All right take it easy, just take it easy.
JERRY: A letter.
JERRY: That's it?
JERRY: You can't go to China What about your job?
JERRY: So write a letter.. move to another...move to Staten Island., 'lot easier to blend in a sea of people in Staten Island than China believe me.
JERRY: Aagh! 
JERRY: So forget about your clothes.
JERRY: Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes.
JERRY: And what, hope for a crash?
JERRY: You know what the odds are on a crash it's a million to one.
JERRY: Euhh...Elaine....
JERRY: Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . What could he do?
JERRY: Does she hate cigarettes?
JERRY: But you don't smoke.
JERRY: You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding.
JERRY: Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again.
JERRY: Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.
JERRY: So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.
JERRY: See you ... me and Kramer...
JERRY: (annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? 
JERRY: They're not making higher roofs.
JERRY: Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid...
JERRY: .....Stupid , stupid.
JERRY: oh! 
JERRY: Well I...
JERRY: What?
JERRY: I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY: Hey! 
JERRY: No. I know what I want.
JERRY: Yeah.,
JERRY: Uh! 
JERRY: I think I'm in love.
JERRY: No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.
JERRY: No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me. She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised what's going on.
JERRY: Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! 
JERRY: I just met her, she's incredible.
JERRY: You can go with Kramer
JERRY: Excuse me.( gets up and opens the door)
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Hey is the same thing as hello. What do you think Jeannie.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Yeah , she's coming to see my act tonight.
JERRY: What's with you?
JERRY: Something on your mind?
JERRY: Looks like there is?
JERRY: Come on. Something's on your mind. Out with it.
JERRY: You don't like her?
JERRY: What's wrong with her?
JERRY: Well you can't take her maybe you can't take me either.
JERRY: That's how it's gonna be.
JERRY: Will you marry me?
JERRY: I would like to propose a toast....Wait a second.. George! 
JERRY: September 21st, first day of Autumn. Leaves changing colours.. Beautiful colors.
JERRY: You see , I kept up my end of the pact.
JERRY: Hey look , Champagne..
JERRY: To our future wives....yeah...
JERRY: Well it's been quite a night I could sure use a cup of coffee.
JERRY: (weakly) I dunno
JERRY: (to waitress) I' ll just have a cup of coffee.
JERRY: More cereal? 
JERRY: Thanks , thanks
JERRY: Yeah , yeah .
JERRY: I think I may have made a big mistake.
JERRY: All of a sudden it hit me, I realized what the problem is; I can't be with someone like me.. 
JERRY: Yeah! 
JERRY: Hello. Oh! 
JERRY: They just took Susan to the Hospital
JERRY: So she was just lying there.
JERRY: Dead?
JERRY: Yeah! 
JERRY: How did it happen?
JERRY: So I guess , you're not getting married?
JERRY: But....
JERRY: Well , now I'm engaged..
JERRY: Well I thought we'd both be getting married.
JERRY: Thank you, no.
JERRY: I don't mind the cemetery.
JERRY: Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.
JERRY: Star Trek II.
JERRY: Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case.
JERRY: Yeah...
JERRY: So it's over?
JERRY: All right, so uh, let's do something later. How 'bout a movie?
JERRY: Yeah, you in?
JERRY: (to Kramer) So how's your karate class going?
JERRY: ...But with punching and kicking.
JERRY: Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine.
JERRY: She's been in Mexico for six weeks.
JERRY: That was July 4th!
JERRY: Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here (points to kitchen), here (points to living room), or here (makes similar circle with his hands).
JERRY: Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?
JERRY: Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?
JERRY: No, I don't.
JERRY: My what?
JERRY: Oh, yeah, that. Well...
JERRY: There's really not that much to tell.
JERRY: See ya.
JERRY: (continuing) No rejection, no guilt, no remorse.
JERRY: I know, I feel bad about that...
JERRY: Eh.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Pride?
JERRY: Well, you're your own boss now.
JERRY: Go ahead.
JERRY: Who's stopping you?
JERRY: Whatever.
JERRY: Oh God.
JERRY: It's Dolores.
JERRY: Mulva.
JERRY: Hi, Dolores. George, you remember Dolores?
JERRY: Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.
JERRY: See ya.
JERRY: Yeah, so did I. You know what? 
JERRY: Not our "all the way", their "all the way." I got the stink of responsibility on me.
JERRY: You stink worse than I do!
JERRY: Where?
JERRY: Isn't it Myanmar now?
JERRY: No, certainly not.
JERRY: No one's gonna listen to you.
JERRY: You're not qualified to work at the catalog.
JERRY: Myanmar.
JERRY: Sammy Davis had it.
JERRY: No, she's not.
JERRY: You guys both have class at the same time?
JERRY: What do you mean you're in the same class?
JERRY: He's nine years old! 
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.
JERRY: Yeah. Was that a beauty or what?
JERRY: No, no, no, it's... "She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her."
JERRY: (stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem?
JERRY: Hey, board of directors. Look at you!
JERRY: Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.
JERRY: All because of Wrath of Khan?
JERRY: Well, it was the best of those movies.
JERRY: Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.
JERRY: I am. It was the world's first.
JERRY: Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... (to himself, cursing her) Mulva!
JERRY: (answering) Hello?
JERRY: Oh, I don't believe this.
JERRY: Hey!
JERRY: How's it look?
JERRY: Huh?
JERRY: Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?
JERRY: I gotta do some research here.
JERRY: Oh, I'm the doofus?
JERRY: You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.
JERRY: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
JERRY: Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? 
JERRY: (on the phone) Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.
JERRY: Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up)
JERRY: So... did you stop by the dojo?
JERRY: How's your confidence level?
JERRY: Self-esteem?
JERRY: Doofus?
JERRY: All right, so what? 
JERRY: What is that?
JERRY: Well, nobody sees the... cover.
JERRY: What happened to you?
JERRY: It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.
JERRY: Vaya con dios.
JERRY: No, he's still stuck at the foundation.
JERRY: Widower? 
JERRY: Hey, Georgie! 
JERRY: Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there?
JERRY: What do you mean you can't go? 
JERRY: He cleared his throat?
JERRY: So?
JERRY: Not getting it.
JERRY: Oh, help me, Rhonda.
JERRY: I gotta go meet Pam.
JERRY: Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.
JERRY: She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?
JERRY: Perpetuation of the species.
JERRY: By the way, just for the record -
JERRY: So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...
JERRY: You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?
JERRY: I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.
JERRY: Yes, it is.
JERRY: I thought you might.
JERRY: Hi, sorry I'm late.
JERRY: You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.
JERRY: Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?
JERRY: C'mon, you want to have a baby.
JERRY: It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?
JERRY: How long did you leave it up there?
JERRY: Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.
JERRY: Is that it?
JERRY: What do you make of it?
JERRY: So, what's on your mind?
JERRY: Pam? 
JERRY: You what?
JERRY: Is that right?
JERRY: What does that mean?
JERRY: What about her name?
JERRY: She's got really nice hair.
JERRY: You've got really specific tastes.
JERRY: She's got nice calves.
JERRY: Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.
JERRY: But I might.
JERRY: Why not? 
JERRY: I think I can! 
JERRY: Pam!
JERRY: Pam!
JERRY: That Pam! 
JERRY: Yesterday. Six-ish.
JERRY: You just met the guy yesterday.
JERRY: A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?
JERRY: Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.
JERRY: I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.
JERRY: I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.
JERRY: Kramer!
JERRY: Hello, Newman.
JERRY: Pam? 
JERRY: Wait a minute! 
JERRY: Alright, Newman! 
JERRY: Why not?
JERRY: I can't believe I'm losing Pam!
JERRY: I thought we were talking about me.
JERRY: Anyway, I don't need your help. (Turns to leave.)
JERRY: Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?
JERRY: C'mon, out with it.
JERRY: Elaine? 
JERRY: When did you build this thing?
JERRY: And?
JERRY: But we already knew that.
JERRY: Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.
JERRY: Please.
JERRY: Hold it, hold it! 
JERRY: C'mon up. (To George) Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'
JERRY: We were just playin.'
JERRY: Uh huh...
JERRY: Why can't I be a soul mate?
JERRY: We're getting vasectomies.
JERRY: It's a little short.
JERRY: All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.
JERRY: They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?
JERRY: But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!
JERRY: (resigned) At least it's show business..
JERRY: What if she's got no interest in you?
JERRY: (dry) He knows.
JERRY: (dry) He knows.
JERRY: Why don't you try your engagement story?
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: (doubtful) I don't know, do you have a--
JERRY: Not bad. Wuh--what does she--
JERRY: Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. 
JERRY: (hands it to him as he asks ELAINE) So how'd it go with Kevin? 
JERRY: Why would anybody want a friend.
JERRY: I mean all that stuff is so small.. ((ELAINE is wryly assessing him)) stupid..
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Gillian. Hiii..
JERRY: It's nice to meet you!
JERRY: She had man-hands.
JERRY: The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.
JERRY: Would she have hooks?
JERRY: Kinda cool lookin'..
JERRY: (leaving too) Yeah. Yeah.
JERRY: Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--
JERRY: It--eight o'clock in the morning! 
JERRY: (disoriented) How long have I been asleep? 
JERRY: (snaps fingers) Now that you mention it.
JERRY: How much are they payin' you?
JERRY: Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: W-w-wha' you got in there?
JERRY: So the picture worked. Amazing!
JERRY: I don't know, but you don't have it.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: (whispers) Damn.
JERRY: Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.
JERRY: So? 
JERRY: So he's Bizarro Jerry!
JERRY: Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.
JERRY: No. It's still a goodbye.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Look. Just, forget it, (already). All right?
JERRY: Tough day at the office?
JERRY: Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.
JERRY: No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.
JERRY: (to self) Oh. Twist off..
JERRY: I can get it. (feeling his face)
JERRY: I don't want to.
JERRY: Okay. (closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self) Didn't come true.
JERRY: Then it does exist.
JERRY: So when are you goin' out with this girl again?
JERRY: So you're gonna burn that bridge.
JERRY: So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.
JERRY: Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal, (steer).
JERRY: Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.
JERRY: Kramer, put the paper down! 
JERRY: I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--
JERRY: An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!
JERRY: (pause) It's your third day..
JERRY: Well. (calling down the hall) Call if you're gonna be late!
JERRY: Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..
JERRY: Hey! 
JERRY: The Bizarro coffeeshop?
JERRY: I read.
JERRY: (pause) Oh. Big deal..
JERRY: (What's goin' on,) like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--
JERRY: (frustrated, to self) The whole system is breakin' down!
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: I wish I could, but, we're friends..
JERRY: Good idea. (phone's ringing, goes to it) (muttering) There's a beach towel on the rack.. (to phone) Yeah.
JERRY: (to drive him crazy) Who is this..
JERRY: (pause) If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?
JERRY: Got it. (but now a man-hand grabs his arm) Uh!
JERRY: I'm right here. (note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand) You're late.
JERRY: Like you care.
JERRY: (calmly getting up with plate of chicken) Oh! 
JERRY: (calm) I ordered in. It's still effort.
JERRY: What's wrong?
JERRY: You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! 
JERRY: The coffeeshop?
JERRY: (pleased) I'll call George!
JERRY: Hey. Isn't that Elaine?
JERRY: Elaine!
JERRY: (quietly crept out) This is really weird..
JERRY: I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!
JERRY: So this is it, huh?
JERRY: (dry) I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw? 
JERRY: Why not?
JERRY: What about over there? 
JERRY: No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.
JERRY: You were livin' in the village then, right?
JERRY: That is disgusting.
JERRY: Well, then you're drivin' me wild.
JERRY: (George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party? 
JERRY: Like with dogs.
JERRY: He's gonna show up anyway.
JERRY: Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?
JERRY: Who wants two? 
JERRY: Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?
JERRY: Yeah I guess I do owe you.
JERRY: No, I'm okay.
JERRY: I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?
JERRY: Yeah, so I didn't miss anything?
JERRY: Elaine danced?
JERRY: Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?
JERRY: For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.
JERRY: And by then you've lost interest.
JERRY: What made him get that thing?
JERRY: Not a very long trip. (Enter Kramer)
JERRY: I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
JERRY: How could that be?
JERRY: No, George was there, he said he had a great time.
JERRY: Oh, what are you talkin' about?
JERRY: Now you're talkin' crazy!
JERRY: (Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
JERRY: Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.
JERRY: You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...
JERRY: The bad fiancé&Mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...
JERRY: The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper!
JERRY: Half of show business is here.
JERRY: That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
JERRY: I'm a joke maker.
JERRY: (To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?
JERRY: Does what?
JERRY: May I see you outside for a moment please?
JERRY: Outside!
JERRY: What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?
JERRY: It's not legitimate.
JERRY: Where did you meet this guy?
JERRY: Kramer. (boom sound)
JERRY: I don't believe this. (They run into theater)
JERRY: Hey, what is going on over there?
JERRY: Are you nuts? 
JERRY: Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.
JERRY: All right, I'm, i,m takin' the camera.
JERRY: Oh man...
JERRY: How was the rest of Death Blow?
JERRY: Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!
JERRY: You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!
JERRY: What are you, crazy? 
JERRY: What if I didn't do it right?
JERRY: People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Well, I did the best I could.
JERRY: I don't want another gig! 
JERRY: We're talkin' federal crime here.
JERRY: No, no, no, no, no, no, no! 
JERRY: Do you even know what this scene is about?
JERRY: No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.
JERRY: Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.
JERRY: I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.
JERRY: I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?
JERRY: I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away)
JERRY: All right, you're beyond stink.
JERRY: And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.
JERRY: Have you ever seen yourself? 
JERRY: No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.
JERRY: You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.
JERRY: Kramer...
JERRY: All right. That's it, I can't work like this.
JERRY: I'm off the project. (He exits)
JERRY: They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
JERRY: Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters)
JERRY: Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Oh now I see. (Buzzer) Yeah.
JERRY: What're we gonna do?
JERRY: I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses!
JERRY: Uh, well. It, uh...
JERRY: Uh... great.
JERRY: Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.
JERRY: Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again.
JERRY: But he's an old man, Elaine.
JERRY: (Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.
JERRY: No you don't.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Thank you. (They continue walking)
JERRY: I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? 
JERRY: I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them are doing her dance as they go)
JERRY: No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver. 
JERRY: What are you doing? 
JERRY: Extra teeth. I love that look. 
JERRY: What mustard stain? 
JERRY: Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain? 
JERRY: I see. She's looking. 
JERRY: They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same. 
JERRY: Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago. 
JERRY: Well how are you going..... 
JERRY: I guess I would. 
JERRY: Not the gown again. 
JERRY: They have gotten to know you. 
JERRY: Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys. 
JERRY: Yeah. 
JERRY: Who's it from? 
JERRY: What if I don't want it? 
JERRY: Maybe I am. 
JERRY: I've never done it before. 
JERRY: Why not? 
JERRY: I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from. 
JERRY: It's not totally impossible. 
JERRY: Why can't I be bombable? 
JERRY: I suppose you think your bombable. 
JERRY: There's more than a couple. 
JERRY: You don't have a Mercedes. 
JERRY: The driver seems a little put out. 
JERRY: Is that Burt Reynolds? 
JERRY: Oh. 
JERRY: That's a lot of skin. 
JERRY: You can barely see her face. 
JERRY: Where are you going? 
JERRY: Oh yeah I like this idea. 
JERRY: Hey 
JERRY: He went to get some steak sauce. Why? 
JERRY: Hello 
JERRY: Hello Leo. You don't have to yell. 
JERRY: How did you get my package? 
JERRY: I don't know what you should do with it. 
JERRY: I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot. 
JERRY: Open the package Leo. 
JERRY: Opening. 
JERRY: No, No bomb. 
JERRY: Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up. 
JERRY: Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal. 
JERRY: Is this my stereo? 
JERRY: What happened to my stereo? 
JERRY: But you were supposed to get me a refund. 
JERRY: So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo? 
JERRY: How is it a write off? 
JERRY: Write it off what? 
JERRY: You don't even know what a write off is. 
JERRY: No. I don't. 
JERRY: I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back. 
JERRY: Still no luck 
JERRY: There's no Zorn or Zoutraph. 
JERRY: Hey what about Dr. Resnick My Uncle Leo is going to see him tomorrow .
JERRY: He's not that good. 
JERRY: Oh yeah. This can't miss. 
JERRY: I don't like this Kramer. Will it be much longer? 
JERRY: Investigation? 
JERRY: Hello Newman. 
JERRY: Define rarely. 
JERRY: Are we about throw here Newman? 
JERRY: Actually I am quite comfortable. 
JERRY: No. 
JERRY: You can't prove anything. 
JERRY: No in a matter of fact it isn't. 
JERRY: I'm clean and you know it. 
JERRY: Where did you get that? 
JERRY: I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation. 
JERRY: Okay. 
JERRY: I have some questions of my own. 
JERRY: The timeless art of seduction. 
JERRY: My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while.
JERRY: Mentor? 
JERRY: Hmm. So Cynthia's your mentor.
JERRY: Well, I like Gabe Kaplan.
JERRY: Yes. And the mentor advises the protégé.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Respect, admiration, prestige.
JERRY: I suppose if it was on the protégé's way to the mentor, they might.
JERRY: It's not a valet, it's a protégé.
JERRY: (checking out George's textbook) Risk management?
JERRY: Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: So get this book on tape.
JERRY: Am I going? 
JERRY: Oh, it was a lovely affair.
JERRY: You gonna do a little yelling?
JERRY: That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?
JERRY: Hey, Copernicus?
JERRY: So, what did you say?
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: He's writing copy?
JERRY: (reading) Jewish singles night?
JERRY: Well why are you going?
JERRY: What are you talking about?
JERRY: Lomez is Jewish?
JERRY: Kramer, you know, I--
JERRY: I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.
JERRY: Hello.
JERRY: No kidding?
JERRY: Bania?
JERRY: Reading for the Blind?
JERRY: So, I finally met the mentor.
JERRY: Oh yeah, she's dating Bania.
JERRY: Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.
JERRY: Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?
JERRY: Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley.
JERRY: Hey, good luck with that.
JERRY: Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people?
JERRY: Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.
JERRY: What the hell is going on here?
JERRY: What are you doing?
JERRY: No, I don't want to.
JERRY: Oh, this is awful.
JERRY: Did you follow the recipe?
JERRY: It tastes like dirt.
JERRY: Kramer, you can't talk to Frank.
JERRY: Yeah, it was alright.
JERRY: No. No, no way, no Bania.
JERRY: Have you seen his act? 
JERRY: Would. Does. Is.
JERRY: So you saw Bania's act?
JERRY: I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.
JERRY: He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.
JERRY: No more mentor?
JERRY: Well at least you and I are okay again.
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: I can tell you what to do.
JERRY: I can tell you what to think.
JERRY: Oh.
JERRY: Kind of in the middle of something here, George.
JERRY: George?
JERRY: I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.
JERRY: Yeah, see ya.
JERRY: What's your problem.
JERRY: Oh, hey Bania.
JERRY: Oh, that's too bad.
JERRY: Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestlé's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--
JERRY: George Costanza is your mentor?
JERRY: About what? 
JERRY: As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protégé of my own.
JERRY: A Mister Kenneth Bania.
JERRY: I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.
JERRY: Well, I don't think I want to date a protégé whose mentor is a Costanza.
JERRY: Have you tried the hamentashen?
JERRY: Bania?
JERRY: Risk management?
JERRY: Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? 
JERRY: Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?
JERRY: No.
JERRY: We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? 
JERRY: They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.
JERRY: (hopeful) Then you admit it was amusing?
JERRY: (thinking) Great. Thanks.
JERRY: So when do I meet this jerk?
JERRY: Who?
JERRY: What song?
JERRY: Desperado?
JERRY: And you're still dating him? 
JERRY: (pointing toward the guy) See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.
JERRY: I invented that.
JERRY: When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers.
JERRY: Elaine.
JERRY: Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.
JERRY: I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.
JERRY: In his dreams.
JERRY: (to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.
JERRY: It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.
JERRY: (as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people.
JERRY: (taking the envelope) Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em.
JERRY: I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.
JERRY: (opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.
JERRY: Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: Ah, who are any of her losers?
JERRY: I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.
JERRY: Signed over a hundred checks this morning.
JERRY: I'm gonna ask this guy something.
JERRY: (to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Ah, I'm one kind.
JERRY: The Fleckman.
JERRY: Right.
JERRY: (not interested) Oh, I'm sure they are.
JERRY: No. I'm fine, thank you.
JERRY: (quiet annoyance) I don't write skits.
JERRY: Oh, where you going? 
JERRY: You look like you could use a...
JERRY: No spiel?
JERRY: So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?
JERRY: You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?
JERRY: Too dumb?
JERRY: (impressed) Well! 
JERRY: Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.
JERRY: What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?
JERRY: Forget it! 
JERRY: You had a date? 
JERRY: Because he's my butler.
JERRY: No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.
JERRY: (flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb.
JERRY: (throws out his hands) What does he listen to? 
JERRY: You know, what you need is a song you can share.
JERRY: Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?
JERRY: Witchy Woman?
JERRY: (getting it) Ahh. Wit-chay Woman.
JERRY: Hey. How was the Rainbow Room?
JERRY: Ah.
JERRY: What for?
JERRY: I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?
JERRY: Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?
JERRY: This has 'international incident' written all over it.
JERRY: What is this?
JERRY: Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank.
JERRY: (leaving) Konichi-wa.
JERRY: (calls) Hey, I'll take one.
JERRY: Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. (pointing at the umbrellas) What've you got in a push-button mini.
JERRY: Bailed? 
JERRY: Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?
JERRY: So, could I...
JERRY: Could I just buy an umbrella?
JERRY: Oh, hi Brett.
JERRY: Ah, I didn't have enough money.
JERRY: No, it's not that, it's the...
JERRY: Oh no, look at the checks! 
JERRY: No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing.
JERRY: (bitter) Not at the moment, Brett.
JERRY: (sarcastic) Thanks for stopping!
JERRY: Boogeyman.
JERRY: I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?
JERRY: (negative) Eehh.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: NBC?
JERRY: Ah. But they told us we must go now.
JERRY: Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it is. (vehement) Just take it!
JERRY: Who?
JERRY: (to himself) Last one.
JERRY: (agonised) Uugh! 
JERRY: Yeah?
JERRY: (kidding) Uncle Leo?
JERRY: Alright, alright. I'll wake 'em up.
JERRY: (to himself) Hmm, testy.
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: It's stuck. (pained) Oww! 
JERRY: I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.
JERRY: (looks round) Don't worry, I'll get you out.
JERRY: (apologetically) Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.
JERRY: (defensive) At least it was just the handle!
JERRY: Fleckman?
JERRY: (singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
JERRY: I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife fight for a citrus drink.
JERRY: Restaurants too?
JERRY: Yea especially Ziti, with that big hole. 
JERRY: Tell him forty and no fork.
JERRY: How about we leave and, come back in a week?
JERRY: Wow. Kenny Rogers Roasters. Finally open. Hey, look at the size of that neon chicken on the roof.
JERRY: He is the gambler.
JERRY: Try and stay calm.
JERRY: Seth! 
JERRY: You wanna grab lunch?
JERRY: Seth, it's me. What's more important than catching up with an old college buddy?
JERRY: Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? 
JERRY: Alright, alright.
JERRY: Hey whatever happened to Moochie?
JERRY: Is that right?
JERRY: Good, as a matter of fact. I almost had my own show in Japan.
JERRY: No
JERRY: I don't know. So what's this job of yours?
JERRY: Mmmm.
JERRY: The, the meeting you blew off?
JERRY: Wasn't that kind of important?
JERRY: You use a Water Pik?
JERRY: So you go in the bathroom at eleven your in bed by what, two?
JERRY: Hello. Anybody?
JERRY: Hey. Why didn't cha get the big one?
JERRY: I don't believe it.
JERRY: Ahh, too bad you got a little, George Costanza thing going on.
JERRY: That's a date?
JERRY: How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?
JERRY: That is so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood horse?
JERRY: What's going on in there?
JERRY: That light!
JERRY: Can't you shut the shades?
JERRY: Oh yeah? 
JERRY: Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the lunch with me?
JERRY: I only knew you through Moochie.
JERRY: Um, actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet. (takes the paper back)
JERRY: How's life on the red planet? 
JERRY: Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?
JERRY: What are you doing?
JERRY: That, that's tomato juice.
JERRY: I don't know Kramer, ahh, my concern is that ....
JERRY: ..living together after a while we... we might start to get on each others nerves a little.
JERRY: Or I could sleep in the park? 
JERRY: Yea, that's no good.
JERRY: How you gonna do that?
JERRY: Seth?
JERRY: I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that couldn't be.
JERRY: But your were an executive, this is fast food.
JERRY: That's not going to be good for anybody.
JERRY: Look Kramer, i-i-if I'm gonna live over there, y-y-you gotta take some of this stuff out. I mean this thing is really freaking me out (holds up a ventriloquist dummy). I feel like its gonna come to life in the middle of the night and kill me.
JERRY: And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my...
JERRY: Oh no.
JERRY: Well don't get too comfortable. As soon as Seth gets a real job you two are gong back in that chicken supernova.
JERRY: (Thinking) What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship. Gotta relax.
JERRY: (startled - eyes wide open) Hello, is somebody there? 
JERRY: Hey buddy. 
JERRY: Oh I'm stressed! 
JERRY: You know my friend Bob Sacamano?
JERRY: Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. and we got to talking, he sells Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.
JERRY: No, but the difference is negligible.
JERRY: Giddee up!
JERRY: Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off that sign?
JERRY: Hello Newman.
JERRY: Hold it. Broccoli? 
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: It's Kramer isn't it? 
JERRY: Expecting Newman? 
JERRY: He was buying quite a load of chicken, almost for two people ...
JERRY: ... as long as one of them is not him.
JERRY: Uh-ha.
JERRY: I sure do miss my apartment. Maybe I'll switch back.
JERRY: I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble. I'll do it myself.
JERRY: All right. (opens door - Red light floods hallway - a buzzing sound emanates.)
JERRY: You got a little problem.
JERRY: Hey Seth. Man it is coming down hard out there.
JERRY: Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business.
JERRY: Home at last. Ahhhh. 
JERRY: Is someone there? 
JERRY: Mr. Marbles?
JERRY: Why are we flyin' over the Andes?
JERRY: Kramer.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.
JERRY: That's very nice, I guess.
JERRY: Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.
JERRY: Can I have a piece of that?
JERRY: Six weeks?
JERRY: Well, so what? 
JERRY: Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?
JERRY: What guys?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.
JERRY: Isn't bunk bad? 
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: Oh hi, Katie.
JERRY: I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high.
JERRY: Yes, all right, Katie.
JERRY: Yes, bye.
JERRY: Yeah, it's no big deal.
JERRY: And you were integral.
JERRY: I'm on next, right?
JERRY: The guy with the lizard.
JERRY: I'm getting bumped? 
JERRY: So you're enjoying the not enjoying.
JERRY: I'm finding that out. (Kramer enters)
JERRY: Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.
JERRY: It was a mix-up, I'm sure.
JERRY: Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?
JERRY: You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.
JERRY: No, let's just do it. (Fire alarm goes off) What? 
JERRY: But I was promised this slot.
JERRY: Fire drill, can you believe that?
JERRY: Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer enters)
JERRY: Middle drawer.
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: Oh hi, Katie.
JERRY: Oh relax, Katie. It's not a problem.
JERRY: No, I don't have any ashtrays.
JERRY: No, Katie, don't-- (He hangs up phone)
JERRY: Is this a repeat?
JERRY: Louise! 
JERRY: Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. (Holds lettuce head) Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts: the intellect, represented here (Pulls off tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large piece) Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats tiny piece of lettuce)
JERRY: What is goin' on in there?
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: It doesn't?
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?
JERRY: I was out.
JERRY: An assembly?
JERRY: I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?
JERRY: Superfreak?
JERRY: ...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.
JERRY: How am I gonna fill two hours?
JERRY: And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table)
JERRY: Are you all right?
JERRY: Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.
JERRY: To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.
JERRY: Exactly.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?
JERRY: And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.
JERRY: So what did you do?
JERRY: But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?
JERRY: You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.
JERRY: So you're never gonna have sex again?
JERRY: So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? 
JERRY: I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.
JERRY: How ya doin'?
JERRY: Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.
JERRY: What for? 
JERRY: I think it has something to do with me.
JERRY: (thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.
JERRY: Where have you been? 
JERRY: Got lost? 
JERRY: Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!
JERRY: The Portuguese waitress?
JERRY: Then what'd you come down here for?
JERRY: It's good to have you back.
JERRY: All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? 
JERRY: Cancelled? 
JERRY: Actually, it was a ********.
JERRY: Jerry.
JERRY: (Gets up) Get out!
JERRY: (Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine?
JERRY: So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya?
JERRY: She's out.
JERRY: Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.
JERRY: I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.
JERRY: (Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying.
JERRY: (Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key?
JERRY: You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.
JERRY: (Picks one up) Mail bags? 
JERRY: (Talking to Elaine) You ate more bread?
JERRY: Did you find out who stabbed him?
JERRY: (Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.
JERRY: There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.
JERRY: (In awe. Whispering) The botched it?
JERRY: Hey. 
JERRY: (Correcting her) Edmund Fitzgerald.
JERRY: (Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.
JERRY: Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?
JERRY: Newman?
JERRY: Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.
JERRY: (Confused) What are you talking about?
JERRY: "Transfer"?
JERRY: You quit the post office?
JERRY: Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.
JERRY: (Cheerfully) Well, a law's a law. (Leaves)
JERRY: There was another crazed ex-girlfriend?
JERRY: Mmm.. Bad how?
JERRY: (Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do?
JERRY: (Agreeing) What's more important?
JERRY: You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the "Astonishing Tales of Costanza".
JERRY: I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.
JERRY: You're the man!
JERRY: I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. (Slams the door on Newman's face. Then tries to delay talking to Newman by keeping the conversation with George going) So, you want a protein shake, or something?
JERRY: (Angered) Hello.. Newman.
JERRY: What's the difference?
JERRY: Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.
JERRY: You're giving up that easy?
JERRY: (Stopping him) No, wait a minute, Newman! 
JERRY: (Fast) Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me!
JERRY: (Confirming) An alliance. (They both shake hands and laugh evily) Now get the hell outta here. (Newman leaves)
JERRY: (Like an Army general) Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! 
JERRY: "Big head" (Scoffs) That's almost a compliment.
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: Hey, George.
JERRY: You can't make it?
JERRY: Alright. (Hangs up)
JERRY: (Saddened) Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.
JERRY: Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?
JERRY: (Takes the bottle from him) Just swallow 'em.
JERRY: Alright, sit down, sit down. (Grabs a pill from the bottle, and starts advancing tward Kramer - like an owner with his dog)
JERRY: C'mon. Just sit down!
JERRY: Sit down! 
JERRY: Lean your head back. Open your mouth! 
JERRY: But, he's a dog! 
JERRY: Alright.. (Heads for the door, grabbing his coat)
JERRY: I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?
JERRY: (Opens the door) C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? 
JERRY: Kramer, outta the car. Out, now!
JERRY: Alright, that's it.. (Grabs Kramer, trying to pull him out of the car)
JERRY: Hey, hey! 
JERRY: Newman, how'd it go? 
JERRY: (Bravely) Well, what if I deliver it?
JERRY: Well, why not?
JERRY: What am I gonna wear?
JERRY: (Excited) I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!
JERRY: (Hands him some mail) There you go. Merry Chirstmas!
JERRY: (Shrugs) Oops. (Continues walking along the route, whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street, then keeps walking)
JERRY: Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, "Photographs - Do not bend".
JERRY: What?
JERRY: (Pleading) I tried my best!
JERRY: You know, this is your coat.
JERRY: Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. (George laughs) So, when do you move into the apartment?
JERRY: What's the matter with you?
JERRY: What giant freak-head?
JERRY: So, it's actually gotten to you? 
JERRY: (Casually, sarcastic) Either way.
JERRY: So what happened to you yesterday? 
JERRY: Five minutes.
JERRY: What's the difference? 
JERRY: Well, we barely knew the guy.
JERRY: That's the way it works.
JERRY: I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?
JERRY: That's enough. (They leave. George comes around the corner.)
JERRY: How did you know about that?
JERRY: He can't do that.
JERRY: What happened?
JERRY: Fantastic.
JERRY: You're still doing that?
JERRY: When you feel guilty.
JERRY: What are you gonna do there?
JERRY: Yes, I know, I know.
JERRY: It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.
JERRY: Is he from the future?
JERRY: Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino.
JERRY: But it's your bodega.
JERRY: You asked her out?
JERRY: How could you ask her out?
JERRY: I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!
JERRY: I'll say.
JERRY: Conjugal visit?
JERRY: George is dating a convict.
JERRY: Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?
JERRY: Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?
JERRY: I sense something is afoot.
JERRY: Allow me. What are you, an idiot?
JERRY: (sits up in bed) Oh what...
JERRY: Is that your "chicken" making all that noise?
JERRY: Who?
JERRY: Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not, a chicken.
JERRY: Well, you picked out a rooster.
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: I'm not having money problems.
JERRY: I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine!
JERRY: You are NOT sending me fifty dollars!
JERRY: Ma! 
JERRY: Good.
JERRY: I thought you were going out with Celia?
JERRY: Having her in jail.
JERRY: Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.
JERRY: Huh. Kurt's an organ donor.
JERRY: So he just shaves his head for no reason?
JERRY: It's just hair.
JERRY: It's brown.
JERRY: So?
JERRY: So Marcelino's going to take down the check?
JERRY: Great! 
JERRY: Ah ha...
JERRY: Kramer, cockfighting is illegal.
JERRY: It's inhumane!
JERRY: It's two roosters peckin' at each other!
JERRY: Yeah!
JERRY: No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt.
JERRY: Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?
JERRY: You let him fight?
JERRY: How long do they usually last?
JERRY: Great!
JERRY: I'm too tired.
JERRY: O.K. (Kramer leaves.)
JERRY: Ah, I'm so sorry.
JERRY: In other words, a normal relationship.
JERRY: Well, she'll still be an ex-con.
JERRY: Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something.
JERRY: Then what is my check still doing up? 
JERRY: New deal?
JERRY: This is Outrageous! 
JERRY: 85 cents? 
JERRY: Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY: But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.
JERRY: No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!
JERRY: Of what?
JERRY: Kramer, give me that rooster!
JERRY: Kramer won't sell.
JERRY: Oh well, thank you, Marcelino.
JERRY: You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
JERRY: First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.
JERRY: Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! 
JERRY: We'll see about that. (Runs to the window and shouts up to Kramer, who's on the roof.) Kramer, I'm comin' up! 
JERRY: Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. (Kramer picks up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.) Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! 
JERRY: Hey, Kramer...?
JERRY: Be careful.
JERRY: Hey, guess what! 
JERRY: I don't know. Where have you been?
JERRY: Oh my God! 
JERRY: Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Where's Celia?
JERRY: hmm. (nodding head)
JERRY: Hey, how's he doin'?
JERRY: Look at the size of his bird!
JERRY: He's a ringer!
JERRY: Kra _ mer!
JERRY: Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.
JERRY: Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.
JERRY: Am I finally getting a baby brother?
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?
JERRY: Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.
JERRY: Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?
JERRY: (exasperated) Ugh.
JERRY: Kramer.
JERRY: We're in the middle of a discussion here.
JERRY: You sold my Cadillac to Jack Klompus?
JERRY: (getting worked up) I don't need the money.
JERRY: (sits on the back of the couch) Oh my god.
JERRY: Yeah, when it's your money, it's fascinating.
JERRY: That Arabian is strong coffee.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: And you misinterpret this how?
JERRY: I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.
JERRY: You're crazy.
JERRY: George.
JERRY: I'm flying down to Florida tomorrow.
JERRY: They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? 
JERRY: Excuse me?
JERRY: Come on, your parents have money.
JERRY: When did they ever spend any money?
JERRY: What are their living expenses?
JERRY: Where do they ever go on vacation?
JERRY: Few hundred grand?
JERRY: Course you may not see it for twenty years.
JERRY: Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?
JERRY: How's your family history?
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City. I'm performing at Bally's.
JERRY: (pulling on a jacket) They had a cancellation and they instantly called me.
JERRY: Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine.
JERRY: I wanna buy back the Cadillac.
JERRY: (reaching into his pocket) Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for it.
JERRY: You bought it for six!
JERRY: (standing) How much d'you want for it?
JERRY: Fourteen thousand.
JERRY: I got your message, (sitting) so I came straight from Atlantic City.
JERRY: (extemporising) Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was registered under Slappy White.
JERRY: Hello.
JERRY: (quiet) Huh. Alright.
JERRY: (extemporising) That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go.
JERRY: I live in New York. (slams the cab door) What the hell happened?
JERRY: What did you do?
JERRY: (exasperation) You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents.
JERRY: My car? 
JERRY: (smiling with pleasure) You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile.
JERRY: Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So...
JERRY: Well...
JERRY: You didn't like that crack about the pen.
JERRY: Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...
JERRY: Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.
JERRY: You're not alone. I'm practically broke.
JERRY: No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.
JERRY: Well, you seem happy.
JERRY: Actually, I haven't heard from 'em yet.
JERRY: 'The ocean called, They're running outta shrimp'?
JERRY: (smiling) Really? 
JERRY: Oh. That's not quite the same.
JERRY: I'm gonna grab a can of balls.
JERRY: I need a can of balls.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: (reading) 'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie, hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'
JERRY: Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document.
JERRY: Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.
JERRY: Yeah. (hands racquet to Kramer) I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it.
JERRY: In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.
JERRY: (accusingly) Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.
JERRY: He called you?
JERRY: To a guy you've never met? 
JERRY: (pulling on a jacket) Mmm-hmm.
JERRY: George used up all my guest passes already.
JERRY: Come on.
JERRY: (tossing the ball) Here you go.
JERRY: (disbelief) Milos?
JERRY: Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log.
JERRY: Kramer wants to die with dignity.
JERRY: D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?
JERRY: George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'
JERRY: (taps George's chest) Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six.'
JERRY: Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.
JERRY: Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you.
JERRY: Hello Milos.
JERRY: (animated) You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about.
JERRY: You can't even play.
JERRY: You could do that?
JERRY: (indicating the woman) Game, set and match, huh Milos?
JERRY: (animated) You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I...
JERRY: (doubtful) Yeah, you'll make it up to me.
JERRY: Tennis, anyone?
JERRY: Hello. Didn't I see you at the pro shop yesterday?
JERRY: (to himself) Hoh, that Milos. (to Patty) Well uh, what shall we do, uhm, care for a cup of coffee?
JERRY: (surprised) Alright.
JERRY: (to himself) Gotta be an easier way.
JERRY: So, you play tennis?
JERRY: Not for me, I love chatting.
JERRY: Who?
JERRY: (explanation) He's new around here.
JERRY: (walking away) Well, I didn't sleep with her.
JERRY: (weary) Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out?
JERRY: Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go.
JERRY: You never really had the right comeback, anyway.
JERRY: I didn't know it was possible not to know that.
JERRY: Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing.
JERRY: I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.
JERRY: (reluctant) Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too.
JERRY: So you hurt Vincent's feelings?
JERRY: (taking the envelope) Wh..What's this?
JERRY: (examining the button) Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like a tooth.
JERRY: (nonplused) You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?
JERRY: Too good.
JERRY: You're on fire today.
JERRY: (quietly) Hey, uh, Milos, I don't mind rolling over here, but could you lighten up on the 'not a man' stuff?
JERRY: (quietly) I told you to cut it out.
JERRY: He's been sleeping a lot. He's still groggy.
JERRY: What happened to Vincent?
JERRY: So what's the great moment? 
JERRY: I know.. How about dessert?
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Yeah. And she picked the day!
JERRY: No, she's great! 
JERRY: She's not Lincoln.
JERRY: I'll pass.
JERRY: Does it ever bother you that this organization-
JERRY: is beating the bushes-
JERRY: to basically give this money away-
JERRY: to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?
JERRY: Wow. That's great! 
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: The Van Buren Boys? 
JERRY: Well, what does that mean?
JERRY: (Sympathetically) She coming of a bad break-up?
JERRY: Any messages?
JERRY: They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.
JERRY: There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
JERRY: No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!
JERRY: Yeah?
JERRY: Is he smart?
JERRY: Hey! 
JERRY: I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
JERRY: Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?
JERRY: Actually, yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! 
JERRY: I guess that's all right.
JERRY: No, absolutely nothing. (They get up to leave) You're fantastic! 
JERRY: (Gesturing to Ellen) Kramer, George, this is Ellen.
JERRY: So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner?
JERRY: You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. (Phone rings, he answers it) Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend.
JERRY: Where is this coming from? 
JERRY: There's nothing wrong with my career!
JERRY: (Fed up) Alright! 
JERRY: You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!
JERRY: They were all like that!
JERRY: Is my toaster oven on there?
JERRY: Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer.
JERRY: Make them interesting.
JERRY: Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents.
JERRY: Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! 
JERRY: I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight.
JERRY: Kramer, this is awful! 
JERRY: What?
JERRY: (To his parents) So? 
JERRY: I knew it! 
JERRY: (After seeing how much his parents like her) Now, I'm not so sure.
JERRY: yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas..
JERRY: Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.
JERRY: (pause) I don't know, they just tell you the night before.
JERRY: (under breath) Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..
JERRY: Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..
JERRY: I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.
JERRY: Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..
JERRY: No openings in arson?
JERRY: I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. (casually leaves)
JERRY: I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.
JERRY: Who are you describing?
JERRY: Named Sharon?
JERRY: Kind of a Yankee prom?
JERRY: You taking Allison?
JERRY: Live?
JERRY: Oh, lithe!
JERRY: It can't be worse than this.
JERRY: She wants to talk.
JERRY: Nobody needs to talk.
JERRY: What'd ya do?
JERRY: And she wants to break up with you..
JERRY: Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."
JERRY: You really like this girl.
JERRY: You've made some Fine Exits.
JERRY: So what do you do? 
JERRY: What for?
JERRY: But I don't want any "sweet action."
JERRY: Not (with) that, no..
JERRY: George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.
JERRY: So, coffee shop?
JERRY: (ironic outrage) The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!
JERRY: No. No Suze.
JERRY: Who are you describin'?
JERRY: Named Suze?
JERRY: Hey, I thought you went to the game.
JERRY: Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! 
JERRY: Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! 
JERRY: Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! 
JERRY: Can you believe that?
JERRY: What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!
JERRY: Yeah, all right.
JERRY: (not) Oh. Too Bad.
JERRY: (singing) Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home.
JERRY: Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?
JERRY: Why not?
JERRY: Mike. You say you're a bookie? 
JERRY: You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.
JERRY: (trying to shut the trunk hood) Something wrong with this trunk.
JERRY: Well why doesn't he just come in?
JERRY: Why is he scared.
JERRY: Yeah, but--
JERRY: It was an accident.
JERRY: (hands up) I don't want it that way.
JERRY: (whatever) Fine..
JERRY: Ah, it's just a car.
JERRY: (wistful) I don't know, I just see you guys together.
JERRY: So Peterman bought it? 
JERRY: Yeah, I know how you feel.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.
JERRY: Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.
JERRY: (firmly matter-of-fact) Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.
JERRY: She's Gooone.
JERRY: (impatient) Gone! 
JERRY: (quiet) Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..
JERRY: (privately amused) Suze? 
JERRY: (proud to Peggy, under his breath) Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. (winks)
JERRY: (smugly, under-his-breath) Not only that, I broke his thumbs.
JERRY: Morning.
JERRY: (applying paste to brush) Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?
JERRY: Ooh-ooh
JERRY: So? 
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: How many years of med school did you have?
JERRY: Jenna's like me. She's very... (searches for word)
JERRY: I'll take fastidious.
JERRY: What is that?
JERRY: They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?
JERRY: Why didn't you pull over?
JERRY: Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.
JERRY: Oh, that adopt-a-highway thing.
JERRY: Aw, looks just like you.
JERRY: So what d'you have to do? 
JERRY: That old scam.
JERRY: At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set.
JERRY: So?
JERRY: Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.
JERRY: By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?
JERRY: You didn't look down?
JERRY: Poor son of a bitch.
JERRY: It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.
JERRY: The engine's made by McDonnell-Douglas.
JERRY: Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.
JERRY: (unheard by Jenna) When the battery runs out.
JERRY: No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.
JERRY: I don't know anything about that.
JERRY: That's the idea.
JERRY: You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs.
JERRY: She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.
JERRY: Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.
JERRY: Being really clean and happy?
JERRY: Disorder?
JERRY: (thoughtful) Hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey, there it is.
JERRY: Nah, we've seen it.
JERRY: What's with the signs?
JERRY: Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway.
JERRY: Hey. So, keys?
JERRY: I guess they leave that up to the general population.
JERRY: Hard to say.
JERRY: Yeah?
JERRY: If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.
JERRY: Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly) and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it.
JERRY: I'm sorry.
JERRY: Obviously never.
JERRY: Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?
JERRY: I wouldn't know where to start.
JERRY: (knocking) Hey, Jenna. Hey!
JERRY: Oh, man!
JERRY: (into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? 
JERRY: No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.
JERRY: Yes, that is a definite possibility.
JERRY: Are you just screwing with me?
JERRY: Hey, how's life on the road?
JERRY: I don't doubt it.
JERRY: What's this?
JERRY: Isn't that some kind of safety thing?
JERRY: What the hell are you talking about?
JERRY: (sarcasm) Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.
JERRY: One-Q? 
JERRY: You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder?
JERRY: Is the flounder here yet?
JERRY: Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Kramer's guys?
JERRY: Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.
JERRY: I don't feel like eating.
JERRY: Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. (pause) Did you?
JERRY: Well, whatever. So, how've you been?
JERRY: Good. (pause) Steak knife?
JERRY: Nah.
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: For what?
JERRY: Dirt? 
JERRY: Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery.
JERRY: Sure. Bye.
JERRY: There, you see? 
JERRY: Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.
JERRY: That's true.
JERRY: But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship.
JERRY: I don't know what that could be.
JERRY: Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.
JERRY: Holy cow! 
JERRY: You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand?
JERRY: He's wailing on that banjo.
JERRY: I just don't understand the raisinettes.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.
JERRY: Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? 
JERRY: Why's he dating a Pepsi? 
JERRY: Musicians. Get a real job.
JERRY: (reading, unimpressed) Ohh, 'Number 1 Dad'.
JERRY: (examining the label) Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Almost.
JERRY: (reluctant) Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy.
JERRY: (grudging) Alright.
JERRY: (holding up the '# DAD' shirt) We're even.
JERRY: (continuing to pack) That's a nice four seconds.
JERRY: Maybe he has money.
JERRY: (zipping up his bag) Sometimes you do.
JERRY: (picking up his bag and coat) Who's she dating? 
JERRY: Stairmaster?
JERRY: Nothin'.
JERRY: Oh, did you get that outta my bag?
JERRY: You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.
JERRY: I could, but I choose not to.
JERRY: (protesting) I..I didn't say that.
JERRY: (smiles) Actually, I am a comedian.
JERRY: (jocular) Eighteen-fifties?
JERRY: (reluctant) Mr Mandelbaum, I...
JERRY: (consenting) Alright.
JERRY: There. Alright?
JERRY: (defensive) He egged me on.
JERRY: He's eighty!
JERRY: (smiling) Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.
JERRY: Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. (indicating) Come on in. You got the cigars?
JERRY: Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.
JERRY: Cigars!
JERRY: (incredulous) You're making your own cigars now?
JERRY: (to Kramer) Hold on a second. (to Morty) Hiya dad.
JERRY: They're Cuban cigar rollers.
JERRY: What is that bubbling sound? 
JERRY: (accusing) You're not wearing a shirt, are you?
JERRY: What colour is it?
JERRY: This is quite a condo.
JERRY: The crepe place?
JERRY: (doubtful) There's crepe money?
JERRY: (apologetic) Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Mr Mandelbaum, please.
JERRY: I think I saw one a coupla doors down.
JERRY: (pointing out the obvious) George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him.
JERRY: I don't know, but you better keep it up.
JERRY: (to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello.
JERRY: I will, I just walked in the door.
JERRY: Ma.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: So?
JERRY: What's the difference?
JERRY: (confused) We're talking about people, right?
JERRY: I thought they smelled pretty nice.
JERRY: Is not.
JERRY: Is not.
JERRY: I'm not having this conversation.
JERRY: Am not.
JERRY: Am not.
JERRY: Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and find my number.
JERRY: (humouring him) That's very nice.
JERRY: Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.
JERRY: (surprise) This is your son?
JERRY: (jocular) You got any kids?
JERRY: (trying to defuse the situation) Look, no-one is lifting anything.
JERRY: (under his breath) Oh no.
JERRY: (laconic) We're already in a hospital.
JERRY: (incredulous) You asked her to move in with you?
JERRY: (musing) What if it's Neil Armstrong?
JERRY: What if it's Neil Diamond?
JERRY: Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.
JERRY: No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.
JERRY: I think he's the same age as the father.
JERRY: I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket.
JERRY: You're cold?
JERRY: Something wrong with your chest?
JERRY: (leaning round Kramer) Where?
JERRY: Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars?
JERRY: Boy, they seem pretty angry about something.
JERRY: I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.
JERRY: He couldn't handle the weight.
JERRY: (placatory) Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me.
JERRY: (incredulous) Oh, come on!
JERRY: He was trying to lift the TV.
JERRY: (consternation) Oh no. (to the bedridden two) It's go time.
JERRY: Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go.
JERRY: (defensive) I didn't ruin your business.
JERRY: (uncertain) Don't you hire people to do that?
JERRY: (thinking) So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?
JERRY: (having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.
JERRY: Here.
JERRY: He was gonna fire you?
JERRY: Tunisia?
JERRY: Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
JERRY: (sardonic) Oh. (smiles)
JERRY: Why are the crepes spraying?
JERRY: That's good stuff.
JERRY: Can you grab a nap at work.
JERRY: So what are you doing now?
JERRY: With a gentleman caller?
JERRY: The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the other -person.
JERRY: Shower?
JERRY: A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little decision.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?
JERRY: Drop one. . . . left!
JERRY: A little less beady today.
JERRY: Sounds like a really cool fort.
JERRY: I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.
JERRY: He's kind of tied up here.
JERRY: Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?
JERRY: So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: What happened?
JERRY: How long did that last?
JERRY: How was the movie?
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.
JERRY: So what are you going to do with the mattress?
JERRY: How about this? 
JERRY: No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.
JERRY: Just . . . do it.
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: What is that smell?
JERRY: You're swimming in the East River? 
JERRY: How could you swim in that water?
JERRY: Swimming?
JERRY: (on phone) hello.
JERRY: Who is this?
JERRY: Why don't you just have him paged?
JERRY: A bomb threat? 
JERRY: I should have some reason.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Over here. You can see right through here.
JERRY: It's kind of cozy.
JERRY: Does it smell like the East River?
JERRY: Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.
JERRY: I don't think it's that bad.
JERRY: No the stools go over there.
JERRY: You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? 
JERRY: Hey look at you.
JERRY: No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.
JERRY: Could you at least get a hat for me?
JERRY: Why are you shouting?
JERRY: Yes this is the terrorist bomber.
JERRY: think I've changed my mind.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out.
JERRY: Yeah, that's right.
JERRY: One second. Hello.
JERRY: Just lie down.
JERRY: All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go.
JERRY: Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat!
JERRY: I saw it.
JERRY: Okay. I wouldn't see it again.
JERRY: I noticed she's big on the phrase "yada yada."
JERRY: No, "yada yada" is good. She's very succinct.
JERRY: Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist enters Monk's)
JERRY: Hey, George, you know Tim Whatley.
JERRY: What's up?
JERRY: Excuse me?
JERRY: Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard.
JERRY: Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.
JERRY: Booze is not a religion.
JERRY: Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage.
JERRY: I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.
JERRY: What're you doing here?
JERRY: Well this is very awkward.
JERRY: Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.
JERRY: All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter)
JERRY: George...
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?
JERRY: I know, but...
JERRY: 5000.
JERRY: And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
JERRY: I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)
JERRY: Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)
JERRY: All right, take it easy.
JERRY: How you doing?
JERRY: Whatley. (Like "Newman")
JERRY: So Whatley sayd to me, "Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic."
JERRY: Don't you see what Whatley is after? 
JERRY: I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.
JERRY: They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?
JERRY: Poor Beth.
JERRY: Oh screw him! 
JERRY: But you yada yada'd over the best part.
JERRY: George is already in there.
JERRY: I thought you were leaning towards Julie.
JERRY: Excuse me, Mother?
JERRY: Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?
JERRY: Hmm, I really need to speak with him.
JERRY: Oh. (Adjusts accordingly)
JERRY: Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
JERRY: Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.
JERRY: No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.
JERRY: And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, "Those aren't buoys." (Father starts laughing) Father...
JERRY: You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?
JERRY: Newer magazines.
JERRY: (In pain) Oh, are you about done?
JERRY: Huh?
JERRY: What about all your Jewish jokes?
JERRY: The Jews?
JERRY: Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
JERRY: Date with Karen?
JERRY: What happened to Karen?
JERRY: Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?
JERRY: So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Kramer, he's just a dentist.
JERRY: I am not an anti-dentite!
JERRY: They do have their own schools!
JERRY: Well, what's wrong?
JERRY: Talk to me.
JERRY: Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody.
JERRY: Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.
JERRY: Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)
JERRY: I'm kinda in the middle of something.
JERRY: Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart.
JERRY: Beth and Arnie broke up.
JERRY: (Shaking his head no) Pff.
JERRY: Hey, where's Marcy?
JERRY: Hey, Kramer, over here.
JERRY: Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents.
JERRY: Very handsome.
JERRY: Hi, Mr. Abbott.
JERRY: Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: That's a good one. Dentists.
JERRY: She went out to get her head shaved.
JERRY: Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.
JERRY: Me neither. I love the previews. 
JERRY: Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go.
JERRY: After two dates!
JERRY: Seven.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: What for?
JERRY: Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?
JERRY: I don't mind the Mayans.
JERRY: Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!
JERRY: Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment. How 'bout I make it up to you with dinner?
JERRY: Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good things.
JERRY: Lemme just check my messages. (to himself) Maybe a nicer girl called.
JERRY: Hello? 
JERRY: Seven?
JERRY: Good meeting?
JERRY: You can do that.
JERRY: So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?
JERRY: So, George...
JERRY: (rising) I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the speed-dial.
JERRY: So? 
JERRY: Yeah, this speed-dial's like a relationship barometer.
JERRY: Well, I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble.
JERRY: (resumes) ...you know, make a good impression.
JERRY: I like the way you think.
JERRY: Oh my God! 
JERRY: Some of us.
JERRY: Hola.
JERRY: What is all this?
JERRY: Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain.
JERRY: Hi Valerie.
JERRY: You're not Valerie.
JERRY: But, I never...
JERRY: You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial.
JERRY: But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Yikes!
JERRY: How could they not fire you?
JERRY: Aw, come on there now.
JERRY: Nonsense. You do everything wrong.
JERRY: Everything.
JERRY: Absolutely. I have no confidence in you.
JERRY: That's the spirit. You suck!
JERRY: Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?
JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: Uh, good.
JERRY: (nervous) What?
JERRY: I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...
JERRY: Valerie's not coming over, is she?
JERRY: No...
JERRY: Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?
JERRY: (leaving hurriedly) Wuhh...
JERRY: Oh my God, George!
JERRY: Kramer, look, it's George.
JERRY: (neutral) Fine.
JERRY: (neutral) No problem.
JERRY: What're you doing with a pricing-gun?
JERRY: (to himself) Still a rip-off.
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.
JERRY: Hold on a second.
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other line. Just a second.
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: Well...
JERRY: Hang on.
JERRY: She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing.
JERRY: Hang on.
JERRY: She wants to be back on yours.
JERRY: Hang on.
JERRY: Fine, if I'm off yours.
JERRY: Sorry. Hang on.
JERRY: Fine, if I'm off yours.
JERRY: Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.
JERRY: (hurried) Great, bye.
JERRY: She said she'll do it.
JERRY: Hang on.
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: She never sees the big picture.
JERRY: Hello, Newman!
JERRY: No.
JERRY: By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?
JERRY: Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.
JERRY: Aww!
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: It's Jerry. Who's this?
JERRY: Oh, hi Valerie. What's up?
JERRY: Wow, poison control? 
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: Hang on just let me pick up a paper.
JERRY: Let's go.
JERRY: For how long?
JERRY: Come on.
JERRY: I'm going to be this guy's friend.
JERRY: New clothes?
JERRY: Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!
JERRY: He asked you to watch them not wear them.
JERRY: You look like a tourist.
JERRY: When you hear like a soft russeling.
JERRY: Oh right, the new job, how is it?
JERRY: So who's the new you?
JERRY: Oh hi Alex.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.
JERRY: (yelling) Get out! 
JERRY: Hmm. That looks new.
JERRY: (uncomfortably) Yeah that's too bad.
JERRY: (uncomfortably) Nothing.
JERRY: I did something stupid.
JERRY: Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched voice) Gone.
JERRY: Well women do it.
JERRY: Well what am I going to tell Alex?
JERRY: Um hum.
JERRY: Hey!
JERRY: You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: So you're pretending to be a tourist?
JERRY: How do you explain your apartment?
JERRY: you moved into a hotel?
JERRY: So get this: we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.
JERRY: So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.
JERRY: Are you nuts? 
JERRY: The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.
JERRY: You're moving to New York? 
JERRY: What is it she think you can't do?
JERRY: How did you do those things?
JERRY: Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?
JERRY: "The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour". I'm confused.
JERRY: Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
JERRY: Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.
JERRY: Oh that's an old wives tale.
JERRY: Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.
JERRY: Why do I have to go on the tour?
JERRY: Hey, how's business?
JERRY: You also shouldn't use a donut.
JERRY: Can we just go?
JERRY: You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.
JERRY: What's that?
JERRY: Oh. Yeah.
JERRY: (in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? 
JERRY: I'm telling you man, I'm losing it.
JERRY: I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.
JERRY: (for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.
JERRY: Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series.
JERRY: Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses.
JERRY: So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did?
JERRY: Maybe I should ask her out?
JERRY: That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's.
JERRY: Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets.
JERRY: They're musicians. That's not a joke.
JERRY: They did it for three years. What's another few months.
JERRY: Like what?
JERRY: I've always wanted to do that...
JERRY: You mean golf?
JERRY: Like this? 
JERRY: That's so strange.
JERRY: Oh, what about 'ladies night'? 
JERRY: Reer.
JERRY: Boy, your really packing it all in.
JERRY: Like what?
JERRY: Stomach ache?
JERRY: Aah, top of the fridge. Hey George, I'm taking that waitress to the Tony's.
JERRY: Where are you sitting?
JERRY: What academy?
JERRY: Hi!
JERRY: Thanks, it's a breakaway.
JERRY: Absolutely.
JERRY: Ok...
JERRY: Thanks, Lyle...
JERRY: So, you and Lyle are roommates?
JERRY: Gay?
JERRY: Is he gay?
JERRY: Are you sure?
JERRY: (to himself) This is a new one.
JERRY: Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude.
JERRY: What do you think it could've been just some dude?
JERRY: I reckon.
JERRY: Dude!
JERRY: It's 10:30 in the morning?
JERRY: So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing?
JERRY: You didn't give that thing back?
JERRY: That's because you didn't win.
JERRY: You haven't even seen it.
JERRY: Hi!
JERRY: No rush.
JERRY: (to himself) I have absolutely no idea.
JERRY: ..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beveridged!
JERRY: It's Kramer.
JERRY: George says hi.
JERRY: Why don't you just come over?
JERRY: He's looking on to fridgerator.
JERRY: I can't do this.
JERRY: He's not doing anything. Goodbye!
JERRY: Are you taking the Tony to Sardi's?
JERRY: Oh, hello.
JERRY: All right, all right.
JERRY: I said no! 
JERRY: Just me? 
JERRY: I can start right away.
JERRY: But not here. (They leave.)
JERRY: I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life.
JERRY: Eh, what?
JERRY: Oh yeah, Sfuzi? 
JERRY: Sure.
JERRY: The one with the...(mumbles.)
JERRY: Ok, ok...
JERRY: No, I'll crab it.
JERRY: What, did you lose your remote?
JERRY: It's Lanette! 
JERRY: Not.
JERRY: No, because that's...
JERRY: Here.
JERRY: I'm trying.
JERRY: Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!
JERRY: Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch?
JERRY: She seems very nice.
JERRY: I'm in show business.
JERRY: I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.
JERRY: Did you tell Peterman about this?
JERRY: Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss.
JERRY: You got the tickets?
JERRY: I like it.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations.
JERRY: 35, and George, on the invitations...
JERRY: I like your nails, that is a great color.
JERRY: This old thing?
JERRY: Ok, let's towel it up.
JERRY: But we're in towels.
JERRY: all right. One second.
JERRY: George, where are those invitations? 
JERRY: No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up?
JERRY: Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George.
JERRY:...what?
JERRY: All right, that's not bad. Now get over here!
JERRY: I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? 
JERRY: What happened to you?
JERRY: Yikes.
JERRY: What happened to you?
JERRY: Cat fight with Raquel Welch.
JERRY: Back on the rack.
JERRY: I think we're still a man short.
JERRY: Yeah...
JERRY: Holland *is* the Netherlands.
JERRY: (picking at his moustache) You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.
JERRY: I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.
JERRY: Because you said this would be better. Remember? 
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job.
JERRY: No more crutches, that must be a relief.
JERRY: Not with a cane?
JERRY: That is a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. Some guy from NBC saw my set, he wants me to do a showcase. I might have another shot at a pilot.
JERRY: We? 
JERRY: Killed?
JERRY: Yeah, killed. Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.
JERRY: Well, I'm glad I brought it up.
JERRY: (looking at Kramer's moustache) Uh, we're not doing that anymore.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: So what's this job?
JERRY: Knicks? 
JERRY: Welcome back to the show.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: What kind do you use?
JERRY: (nods) Look, postcard from Elaine from Europe.
JERRY: Remember David Puddy?
JERRY: Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order.
JERRY: Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a men's room. That's the end of that.
JERRY: He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. He's a time slot hit.
JERRY: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
JERRY: Do I have to ask?
JERRY: Why are you buttering your face?
JERRY: Oh Moses smell the roses.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: I don't want to.
JERRY: (places two slices of bread against Kramer's face) That is close.
JERRY: You got the job?
JERRY: Hold on, they think you're handicapped?
JERRY: How can you do this?
JERRY: He drove a car with no arms?
JERRY: Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you?
JERRY: You can eat it?
JERRY: Oh my god, it's Bania and Jenna.
JERRY: The tooth brush in the toilet bowl.
JERRY: I don't believe this.
JERRY: No! 
JERRY: Someone's cooking.
JERRY: Hello, Newman.
JERRY: (cutting in) I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman.
JERRY: No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter (pauses) Oh no!
JERRY: Kramer!
JERRY: Look at your skin.
JERRY: Technically, you're sautéed. So, what are you doing for that?
JERRY: Is that what the doctor said?
JERRY: Yea.
JERRY: Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with you?
JERRY: What happened?
JERRY: Oh no, not you too?
JERRY: You know what's good for that? 
JERRY: Hello? 
JERRY: Oh, like what, Ovaltine? 
JERRY: You think that's funny?
JERRY: You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!
JERRY: Oh, I'm gonna puke.
JERRY: You mugged Stephen Hawking?
JERRY: Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at no more than three miles an hour.
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: Hey, Lainie, how's the trip going?
JERRY: Who's that?
JERRY: Who?
JERRY: Get me some duty free Kahlua.
JERRY: Sounded good.
JERRY: Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by the big showcase tonight.
JERRY: That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little off.
JERRY: That's right, I'm taking a dive.
JERRY: I'm laying down! 
JERRY: We're four months apart.
JERRY: That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without the cushy timeslot.
JERRY: If you'll excuse me.
JERRY: (OC) Hey everybody! 
JERRY: What's the deal with lampshades? 
JERRY: And what's with people getting sick?
JERRY: I mean, what's the deal with cancer?
JERRY: What are you talking about? 
JERRY: Like who?
JERRY: He *had* cancer!
JERRY: Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you.
JERRY: Ah, the sweet stench of failure.
JERRY: Ouch.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Oh, I'm gonna puke.
JERRY: So you’re staying at Play Now?
JERRY: But they not you aren’t handicapped, aren’t you ashamed?
JERRY: Oh, it’s just this stupid thing.
JERRY: (doing the voice) No-o-o-o.
JERRY: All right. You know this girl Clare I am seeing?
JERRY: Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.
JERRY: Well, her belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) I’m bored. Talk to me.
JERRY: Hey, look whose here - Puddy.
JERRY: And yet he continues to live.
JERRY: Well, that’s it. You two are back together.
JERRY: The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.
JERRY: Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You can’t do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.
JERRY: That’s different. I didn’t have feelings for those people. But you, you’ll backslide
JERRY: Stakes?
JERRY: Dollars?
JERRY: Done.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So…(throws away belt) that’s it!
JERRY: Oh yes, quite.
JERRY: Of course it’s a sliding scale.
JERRY: (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! 
JERRY: (doing the voice) La la la.
JERRY: Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? 
JERRY: Which part? 
JERRY: No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.
JERRY: I can ball park it.
JERRY: Hey, I called you last night, where were you?
JERRY: George?
JERRY: Well, I was here, that’s everyone (laughing).
JERRY: Are those the same shoes as yesterday?
JERRY: Your hair, it’s somewhat de-poofed.
JERRY: Wait a second, what’s going on here?
JERRY: (screams).
JERRY: Hand it over. Pay up.
JERRY: Then what do you call it? 
JERRY: Ah, dinner! 
JERRY: Sex, that’s meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; that’s heavy. That’s like an hour.
JERRY: And you are?
JERRY: Who’s he?
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.
JERRY: Alright, it’s time to go.
JERRY: (sarcastically) I know!
JERRY: Actually, that is not a bad idea.
JERRY: Now, it’s time to go.
JERRY: Hello
JERRY: (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, what’s going on?
JERRY: So, are you going to leave?
JERRY: I thought you’re like Hitler in the bunker?
JERRY: I’m getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other line beeps) I’m getting another call, see ya…(answers call) Hello!
JERRY: (looking shocked) Really? 
JERRY: No, I don’t.
JERRY: Hey! 
JERRY: Oh yeah, hold on.
JERRY: Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerry’s office. (Elaine is looking confused). We’re going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean he’s already left?
JERRY: Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?
JERRY: Well, just…
JERRY: Do you have to write all this stuff down.
JERRY: So, how hot did it get?
JERRY: I guess you can take anything, but actual work.
JERRY: (doing the voice) Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!
JERRY: Oh that makes a lot of sense.
JERRY: (giggling)
JERRY: Oh, nothing. (still giggling)
JERRY: Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. We’ve been doing this silly, dumb voice.
JERRY: No, it’s not you. It’s your stomach, he’s taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
JERRY: No it’s…
JERRY: Hey, we’re kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?
JERRY: (Screams) GET OUT!
JERRY: No body said you’re fat. He’s a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy.
JERRY: No, he’s just a little bloated.
JERRY: It’s mostly water weight.
JERRY: Line two?
JERRY: Oh…
JERRY: So you’re sure you’re not still angry about last night?
JERRY: Never?
JERRY: What about if you’re not around?
JERRY: So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?
JERRY: I can do that.
JERRY: I don’t know.
JERRY: (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la. (haha)
JERRY: So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. What’s the matter?
JERRY: No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o.
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
JERRY: See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.
JERRY: No, I don’t think so. I’ve seen you two together. You make each other miserable. It’s kismet.
JERRY: Done.
JERRY: You’re in there again.
JERRY: What is this? 
JERRY: Yeah. Nine o’clock.
JERRY: (doing the voice) Good-bye Kramer.
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: (on the phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second. (George walks in – Jerry asks George) So we definitely don’t want to do the voice anymore? 
JERRY: Trouble down at the plant?
JERRY: I understand (not really understanding, lol).
JERRY: You’re not…
JERRY: Go again?
JERRY: Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha.
JERRY: They got away.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, I’ll see ya.
JERRY: I can’t. I got to meet Clare.
JERRY: Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.
JERRY: Darren?
JERRY: Uh, bathroom.
JERRY: I thought it was open to the public.
JERRY: Wow! 
JERRY: Wow! 
JERRY: There’s the giant ball of oil. Clare’s right underneath that thing. Clare! 
JERRY: This is going to be a shame.
JERRY: Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess you’re not going in anymore.
JERRY: So they’re not paying you your…
JERRY: So you’re pretty much…
JERRY: What ever happened to Darren?
JERRY: So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that… (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil…
JERRY: I’m just so glad it’s back.
JERRY: Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.
JERRY: I get peeved.
JERRY: Miffed.
JERRY: Irked?
JERRY: She says I suppress my emotions.
JERRY: Good body.
JERRY: But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.
JERRY: Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!
JERRY: Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.
JERRY: Fix a screen door in Queens.
JERRY: Not goin' to the Knick game.
JERRY: You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift.
JERRY: Damn it, they gave me cream! 
JERRY: You're damn right you're not buying it!
JERRY: I'm open. There's just nothing in there.
JERRY: Oh, you think I'm lying about this?
JERRY: Well, I'm not.
JERRY: Oh, stop it.
JERRY: That's enough!
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: Tongue?
JERRY: Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.
JERRY: Hello? 
JERRY: Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?
JERRY: Good.
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: What do you need it for?
JERRY: (Knocking on Kramer's door) Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? 
JERRY: Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.
JERRY: You barbecuing tonight?
JERRY: So, where do you want to eat tonight?
JERRY: Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!
JERRY: Double good-bye! 
JERRY: Yeah! 
JERRY: That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.
JERRY: It's Patty.
JERRY: (Crying) What--what is this salty discharge?
JERRY: This is horrible! 
JERRY: Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.
JERRY: I don't know what's happening to me.
JERRY: That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.
JERRY: You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?
JERRY: Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?
JERRY: I love you, George. Come here.
JERRY: Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.
JERRY: Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer!
JERRY: I love you, Costanza.
JERRY: What happened to you, pal?
JERRY: Are you all right?
JERRY: So, you're using Frank's relaxation method?
JERRY: Sit down, Elaine.
JERRY: I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.
JERRY: Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.
JERRY: Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning...
JERRY: When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!
JERRY: Elaine...
JERRY: I'm asking Elaine to marry me.
JERRY: Elaine?
JERRY: Lippman?
JERRY: Can I help you?
JERRY: What happened here, Kramer?
JERRY: Kramer!
JERRY: You don't look well.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.
JERRY: He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?
JERRY: George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?
JERRY: Yikes. Well, good look with all that.
JERRY: I think you scared me straight.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: I tell ya, I don't see it happening.
JERRY: He doesn't work here anymore.
JERRY: (Leaving) Right back at ya, Slick.
JERRY: Are you sure you can't stay longer?
JERRY: He was 96 years old.
JERRY: Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?
JERRY: Did you give blood?
JERRY: In case of what?
JERRY: Are we finished?
JERRY: Who wants to responsible? 
JERRY: What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?
JERRY: Elaine, what do you think?
JERRY: Didn't go for it, huh?
JERRY: So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?
JERRY: Natural? 
JERRY: Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.
JERRY: I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.
JERRY: What the hell is that?
JERRY: Oh, why?
JERRY: What, it...it's here in the building?
JERRY: No I don't! 
JERRY: You know it and I ditched all my junk food.
JERRY: Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.
JERRY: Is this about me?
JERRY: Oh, then I lost interest.
JERRY: Hey, what are you doing here? 
JERRY: Oh no, where's the blood? 
JERRY: What is this?
JERRY: What about this? 
JERRY: Ooh, you're sick! 
JERRY: Hey, what's going on? 
JERRY: Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore...
JERRY: Aaah...
JERRY: Aah!
JERRY: I can see that! 
JERRY: I'll remember that.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.
JERRY: So, how's the fornicating gourmet?
JERRY: George, we're trying to have a civilization here.
JERRY: Hey, how was baby-sitting?
JERRY: Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: I'm not touching that thing.
JERRY: Oh, no...
JERRY: Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck.
JERRY: All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: Kramer called you?
JERRY: Yes, I'm fine.
JERRY: I don't need a personal trainer. (Kramer comes in) all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.
JERRY: Why are you calling my parents?
JERRY: Why here?
JERRY: Ok...
JERRY: Fine...
JERRY: No no no no no no no no no no! 
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: Mr. Mandelbaum? 
JERRY: Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?
JERRY: Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?
JERRY: For what?
JERRY: How many session did my parents paid for?
JERRY: What is this?
JERRY: I thought you were gonna watch a video.
JERRY: Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.
JERRY: Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.
JERRY: No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum...
JERRY: So, the free love buffet is over?
JERRY: Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.
JERRY: What's going on?
JERRY: Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.
JERRY: No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.
JERRY: All right, that's enough of that. (Jerry takes the plates and hands them to a waitress.)
JERRY: Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.
JERRY: It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum.
JERRY: What's wrong with yours?
JERRY: All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!
JERRY: Is this really necessary?
JERRY: What if I can't keep up?
JERRY: What's going on?
JERRY: Oh my God, the blood!
JERRY: Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.
JERRY: What's the kid doing here?
JERRY: Oh, that's a drag...
JERRY: Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.
JERRY: Then who?
JERRY: (on the phone) Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.
JERRY: (hanging up the phone) Oh! 
JERRY: I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.
JERRY: No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? 
JERRY: Why? 
JERRY: He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris.
JERRY: So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?
JERRY: Too bad. It was erotic.
JERRY: 'Pottery Barn'?
JERRY: Why don't you just throw 'em out?
JERRY: (taking a catalog) Can I have one? 
JERRY: So call now.
JERRY: That's him.
JERRY: What do you think? 
JERRY: So, maybe they had Chinese food?
JERRY: Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's leftovers.
JERRY: It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?
JERRY: So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new guy, in a big pot of love stew.
JERRY: Stop the mail?
JERRY: Hey, Frankie! 
JERRY: Inside the van?
JERRY: We were ten.
JERRY: I don't want a van.
JERRY: You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it.
JERRY: Always helpful.
JERRY: Aye, aye.
JERRY: Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.
JERRY: Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it?
JERRY: No, no, no. Just hypothetically.
JERRY: No! 
JERRY: Where'd you get the bricks?
JERRY: So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? 
JERRY: I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.
JERRY: OK.
JERRY: I don't want to trade.
JERRY: Hey, you know what? 
JERRY: But this is what you've always wanted.
JERRY: Aw, that's kind of sweet.
JERRY: Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?
JERRY: Mother of God.
JERRY: That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this?
JERRY: That is the guy!
JERRY: No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial.
JERRY: I know. They're not even related.
JERRY: Hey, have fun at the... family reunion. (George exits) So, what do you know about this Jack fellow?
JERRY: Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?
JERRY: (turning on the commercial) Right, quiet dignity. As opposed to, say, this?
JERRY: Oh, yes.
JERRY: (answering the phone) Hello? 
JERRY: You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.
JERRY: Two.
JERRY: Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?
JERRY: All right, just get out of here.
JERRY: OK, fine. 
JERRY: You put that in!
JERRY: You want to trade me an undershirt?
JERRY: That's disgusting.
JERRY: She's into it?
JERRY: So have your parents found out about it?
JERRY: Brave new world, alright.
JERRY: Hey, how's the anti-mail campaign going?
JERRY: It's Sunday.
JERRY: Hey, I want my van keys back.
JERRY: Are you insane? 
JERRY: Oh, no, not Frankie.
JERRY: Oh, no, the woods! 
JERRY: Frankie! 
JERRY: Have a nice night.
JERRY: (finding Frankie, in his hole) Frankie... come on out of there.
JERRY: But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.
JERRY: Yeah, let's just get out of here.
JERRY: Hey, George!
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: You must be George's cousin.
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: Don't go a-knockin'.
JERRY: Oh, yeah.
JERRY: I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.
JERRY: Yeah, ya know Cain slew Able.
JERRY: Oh, no.
JERRY: Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts, so he killed him.
JERRY: Ya broke my blender, didn’t ya?
JERRY: I knew it.
JERRY: Why were you making gravel?
JERRY: Of course. It's garbage.
JERRY: Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.
JERRY: Come on, Kramer, get out of there.
JERRY: (moans) Ohhh (walks away)
JERRY: And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
JERRY: Wow! 
JERRY: Where did you get all these?
JERRY: Super bowl! 
JERRY: I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
JERRY: I just want a, touch ‘em a little.
JERRY: You ran over some pigeons? 
JERRY: Course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.
JERRY: So Miranda's cooled on ya?
JERRY: Yeah, me neither.
JERRY: Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!
JERRY: Here comes one.
JERRY: So he just sidles up?
JERRY: Maybe you just didn't see him.
JERRY: Hakuna Matata?
JERRY: That doesn't make it right.
JERRY: See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup...
JERRY: Oh my God!
JERRY: How did you get this in here?
JERRY: So where you gonna sleep?
JERRY: I'm gonna get that. (walks across the set towards the blue curtain)
JERRY: So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.
JERRY: Yeah, that was me.
JERRY: An Army Pete.
JERRY: He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.
JERRY: You, sidle? 
JERRY: What happened?
JERRY: So they're like everyone else.
JERRY: (sound of gunfire) Pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, Pkeeew!
JERRY: I'm sorry. Got any booze? 
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: Ohh, will not “cause drowsiness"
JERRY: Uhn-uh-uhn - Uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer… A-Ha ha! 
JERRY: What's he here for?
JERRY: Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them.
JERRY: Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I, guess she passed out!
JERRY: She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love!
JERRY: Oh, like he's not just carrying you! 
JERRY: So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought: ... What a coincidence. We're just about to eat.
JERRY: ... I think. Have some more wine. (Jerry pours his whole glass of wine into her glass.)
JERRY: Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.
JERRY: More heavy gravy?
JERRY: Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.
JERRY: What about my "questionable material"?
JERRY: Jim Fowler? 
JERRY: Tic-Tacs work?
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Okay, one victim.
JERRY: You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.
JERRY: You're like eight years old.
JERRY: It was great! 
JERRY: No, not a thing.
JERRY: What, What is this? 
JERRY: Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine?
JERRY: So the whole set was destroyed?
JERRY: So the squirrel's gonna make it?
JERRY: On the couch? 
JERRY: Morning.
JERRY: But why?
JERRY: You don't think she's just talking to me?
JERRY: You shut up.
JERRY: We'll come to work with you.
JERRY: And shopping.
JERRY: The boom box incident?
JERRY: Seems reasonable.
JERRY: Even more reasonable.
JERRY: And that guy is your new boss?
JERRY: Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.
JERRY: Neither have I.
JERRY: Where did you get this thing?
JERRY: Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.
JERRY: Mmhu.
JERRY: What's with you?
JERRY: Your whole building smells like potatoes.
JERRY: I think we might have one left in the stock room.
JERRY: Well, I have this neighbor...
JERRY: Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?
JERRY: Cause I hit a whopper last week!
JERRY: He took out Kruger?
JERRY: Where did you get that butcher's coat?
JERRY: Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.
JERRY: Dermatology?
JERRY: Saving lives? 
JERRY: Oh, what's the point?
JERRY: Revenge date? 
JERRY: Dermatologist? 
JERRY: You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.
JERRY: Flowers?
JERRY: So, you've done this?
JERRY: Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?
JERRY: It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!
JERRY: You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!
JERRY: She saved your life?
JERRY: Skin cancer! 
JERRY: He looks like a Peanuts character.
JERRY: You can do that.
JERRY: You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.
JERRY: I understand.
JERRY: True. You mean, for you?
JERRY: What about your sea sickness?
JERRY: I don't know if they have land guys.
JERRY: Drawer.
JERRY: What are they for?
JERRY: Come again?
JERRY: Eh, it went okay.
JERRY: Yeah, I started out real classy...
JERRY: But then I found out about the skin cancer.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Sadly, that knowledge could've help me.
JERRY: Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!
JERRY: Must I?
JERRY: How does that reflect me?
JERRY: So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian...
JERRY: Was it pimple popper MD?
JERRY: Still got it.
JERRY: What the hell is this?
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...
JERRY: Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...
JERRY: What, she gave me hives?
JERRY: She did kind of touch my face.
JERRY: It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.
JERRY: I don't know, this? 
JERRY: Where do you suppose that could've come from?
JERRY: Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice?
JERRY: I want the antidote, pimple popper!
JERRY: Am I? 
JERRY: So, Kramer pulled it off?
JERRY: Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!
JERRY: I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? 
JERRY: Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.
JERRY: Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners.
JERRY: What are you doing?
JERRY: That's my hand towel! 
JERRY: Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you (throws the bottle to Kramer.)
JERRY: I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.
JERRY: Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad.
JERRY: Aloe. So where's that lock smith?
JERRY: (tapping the spatula while waiting for waffles to be done) Any second now. Light is on! 
JERRY: (looking at her) How about that.
JERRY: She didn't even want a napkin.
JERRY: Oh, it's a scene.
JERRY: I don't really have enough room.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Back together?
JERRY: Ah...
JERRY: Why now?
JERRY: Still with the neck hole?
JERRY: A cashmere sweater.
JERRY: No, I think the head does most of the stretching.
JERRY: That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?
JERRY: Ten minutes.
JERRY: So?
JERRY: (seeing Kramer struggle to open a soda, spilling it all over) I think the damage is probably already done. (interrupting Kramer's inadequate attempt to clean up the soda) All right! 
JERRY: Mmm.
JERRY: (playing Scrabble with his naked girlfriend) Zephyr? 
JERRY: No, I do not challenge.
JERRY: I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles.
JERRY: Sure.
JERRY: Coughing... naked... It's a turn-off, man.
JERRY: When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion.
JERRY: But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.
JERRY: Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it.
JERRY: (pointing to Kramer's hair) You got some suds over here.
JERRY: Oh, come on!
JERRY: You promise you'll never come in here again?
JERRY: (standing in the bathtub) Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.
JERRY: But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.
JERRY: No, I told you, it's just a dry run.
JERRY: That's Step Ten?
JERRY: You're not gettin' any skin, Kramer.
JERRY: What happened to you?
JERRY: (giving him a steak from the fridge) Here ya go.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: (closing the door on him) Oh!
JERRY: Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for show.
JERRY: Please don't crouch.
JERRY: Oh, that's bad. Especially that area.
JERRY: Uhh...
JERRY: Look, please stop! 
JERRY: (leaving the room) I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much.
JERRY: Well, technically he did apologize.
JERRY: So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?
JERRY: Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar.
JERRY: Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: (answering the ringing phone) Hello?
JERRY: World War I plane?
JERRY: When are ya gettin' out?
JERRY: (naked, carrying a belt sander) I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.
JERRY: I thought naked is good.
JERRY: He took you to Rage-aholics? 
JERRY: You've got a little rage.
JERRY: By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.
JERRY: (seeing Elaine enter Monk's) Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body?
JERRY: That's it?
JERRY: Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--
JERRY: So you don't think it's attractive?
JERRY: So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is better?
JERRY: Yes, clothes. This is normal.
JERRY: Oh... yeah. What? 
JERRY: Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a...
JERRY: We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked.
JERRY: So what are you up to?
JERRY: Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.
JERRY: Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.
JERRY: Hey, Tim. Great party.
JERRY: You have a standard fake?
JERRY: (Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat.
JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry.
JERRY: You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.
JERRY: Hey! 
JERRY: Didn't you call in sick yesterday?
JERRY: (Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here?
JERRY: See? 
JERRY: Oh, that's nice.
JERRY: To a children's charity!
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: "Atomic Sub"? 
JERRY: What does that mean?
JERRY: When George was growing up..
JERRY: His father..
JERRY: Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.
JERRY: And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?
JERRY: And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
JERRY: So?
JERRY: No, you walk out.
JERRY: No, you wait for the movie!
JERRY: You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! 
JERRY: So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?
JERRY: What strike?
JERRY: You?
JERRY: Bagels?
JERRY: Why didn't you ever mention this?
JERRY: Hey, Tim.
JERRY: Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.
JERRY: Gwen?
JERRY: (Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really?
JERRY: Have you come across this?
JERRY: (Relating) Like the Batman villain?
JERRY: So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up: The good, the bad, or the ugly.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: (Reading it) "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." - What is that?
JERRY: (Continuing reading) "The Human Fund. Money for people."
JERRY: It has a certain understated stupidity.
JERRY: ..Yeah.
JERRY: How was your first day?
JERRY: Your hands were in the dough?
JERRY: Happy Festivus!
JERRY: When George was growing up..
JERRY: His father..
JERRY: You're still trying to gget that free sub?
JERRY: Is there a captain's hat involved in this?
JERRY: Boy, am I glad to see you.
JERRY: You never know.
JERRY: So, uh, what do you feel like eating? 
JERRY: (Shocked) You're telling me.
JERRY: Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.
JERRY: I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?
JERRY: Alright, I'll give it a shot! 
JERRY: That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.
JERRY: Oh, that's classy.
JERRY: I there. This is Kramer, and Frank.
JERRY: Uh, why don't we stay here? 
JERRY: Why? 
JERRY: Oh.. I know who's cooking today!
JERRY: Hey, Georgie!
JERRY: I'll be here.
JERRY: She didn't touch it.
JERRY: 20 thousand dollars from Kruger? 
JERRY: Excuse me?
JERRY: You want to give something back? 
JERRY: You're going to start your own charity?
JERRY: They nailed you on the 20 G's?
JERRY: Gwen! 
JERRY: Gwen. Gwen, wait! 
JERRY: I thought you were on strike?
JERRY: Yeah, they have been promising that for a while.. 
JERRY: I think Ed Begley Jr. has one. 
JERRY: What about Harrison Ford? 
JERRY: Well, what do you think the big holdup is? 
JERRY: Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities? 
JERRY: It's like we're living in the '50s here. 
JERRY: (To Kramer) Would you stop it? 
JERRY: (Gestures to his forehead) You’re getting that vein again. 
JERRY: (Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal. 
JERRY: I guess he graduated. 
JERRY: (To Kramer) Thank you. 
JERRY: All right. Calm down. 
JERRY: (To Kramer) All right, we’re goin’ in. 
JERRY: (Scolding) George. (To salesman) Sorry, we’re just waiting for David Puddy. 
JERRY: Hey. 
JERRY: Ah. Where’d you go? 
JERRY: So, Puddy, I decided I’m gonna go with another 900 convertible. 
JERRY: (As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George. 
JERRY: So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? 
JERRY: Oh. Sorry, I didn’t know.. 
JERRY: I saw one once that could do sign language. 
JERRY: Yeah, Koko. 
JERRY: No. We both just saw the same monkey. 
JERRY: (Getting a dollar out) Where’s your money? 
JERRY: Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit? 
JERRY: No. 
JERRY: No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five. 
JERRY: Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - they’re doing sign language now. 
JERRY: What do you think the Nazis were doin’? 
JERRY: (Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the ‘80’s, and it’s still relatable today. 
JERRY: (Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there. 
JERRY: Either that, or they’ve got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why don’t you just go to the cashier? 
JERRY: How much was under there? 
JERRY: (While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? 
JERRY: Hey, can I have my dollar back? 
JERRY: (Sees Elaine leaving) Hey! 
JERRY: Did you two break up? 
JERRY: "Rust-proofing"? 
JERRY: "Finder’s fee"? 
JERRY: Hey, George! 
JERRY: No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, he’s treatin’ me just like a regular customer, now! 
JERRY: (Threatening tone) So, listen, Puddy. When we first started this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you want to play hard ball, I got my friend, George, here, and he can play pretty hard… ball. (Leaving the negotiation to George) George, vein it up. 
JERRY: George! 
JERRY: Yellow? 
JERRY: (Pleading) George, would you help me, please? 
JERRY: Sing it, sister! 
JERRY: (Exasperated) Oh, God… 
JERRY: (To Puddy) I’ll be right back. 
JERRY: Hey, George! 
JERRY: (Over the phone) Elaine, you’ve got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin’ me on this car, which is yellow now! 
JERRY: (Banging the phone against the booth) Elaine! 
JERRY: You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal. 
JERRY: You’re gonna get back together, anyway. It’s thousands of dollars! 
JERRY: Come on. Then you don’t have to see him again ‘til my 15,000-mile check. 
JERRY: Fine. 
JERRY: No. No lunch. 
JERRY: All right! 
JERRY: Bye. (Hangs up) 
JERRY: (Frustrated, he reacts) Everybody’s ripping me off! 
JERRY: No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. What’s important is you two getting back together. Eh, then we’ll talk about the car. 
JERRY: Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why don’t we all just sit down and talk about it? 
JERRY: Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you. 
JERRY: (Smiling, like a salesman) All right. Now, what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today? 
JERRY: All right. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle: Arby’s no more than once a month. And in exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game, and doesn’t read a book. 
JERRY: So, you’re back together? 
JERRY: All right, all right. All right, that’s enough! 
JERRY: So, I’m gettin’ the insider’s deal? 
JERRY: And where does it end? 
JERRY: And who were you tryin’ to set up, anyway? 
JERRY: I think there’s a mental hospital near here. 
JERRY: So, Puddy wear's a man fur?
JERRY: And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.
JERRY: You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.
JERRY: Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.
JERRY: Cheapness is not a sense.
JERRY: I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?
JERRY: But then anyone can just look in and see you.
JERRY: Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: That's a five.
JERRY: Except the store's in Delaware.
JERRY: Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.
JERRY: Irish money?
JERRY: Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.
JERRY: George, I am loving this no wallet thing.
JERRY: You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.
JERRY: Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place.
JERRY: Music?
JERRY: But I could do that and the music.
JERRY: I was ready to get jiggy with it.
JERRY: Hey, Elaine.
JERRY: So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?
JERRY: So, we're givin' him nothing?
JERRY: Did you at least get him a card?
JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?
JERRY: (talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass.
JERRY: Because you threw it out.
JERRY: But you did actually throw his coat out the window.
JERRY: But that's you.
JERRY: Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.
JERRY: What was that?
JERRY: All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.
JERRY: No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?
JERRY: Compact, lipstick, all this?
JERRY: What are you, a medieval dungeon master?
JERRY: Ow! 
JERRY: You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.
JERRY: Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
JERRY: I'm not carrying a purse.
JERRY: Oh.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?
JERRY: What?
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Well, so what? 
JERRY: What is that noise?
JERRY: You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.
JERRY: What was that pop sound?
JERRY: It's European.
JERRY: Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? 
JERRY: What, he doesn't like my taste in music?
JERRY: You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!
JERRY: I have to do what?
JERRY: I'm not wearing the fur.
JERRY: Is that right?
JERRY: Newman, too?
JERRY: That's my walkman!
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: George, did you get that chair yet?
JERRY: You know what? 
JERRY: Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.
JERRY: No, you don't have to buy anything.
JERRY: I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
JERRY: Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
JERRY: Your good friend is morbidly obese.
JERRY: It's not a purse. It's European!
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: How do I look?
JERRY: Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.
JERRY: It sure is.
JERRY: That's true.
JERRY: Oh, thanks.
JERRY: Maybe this isn't my coat.
JERRY: No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.
JERRY: Hey! 
JERRY: The...black, leather...thing with a strap.
JERRY: Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!
JERRY: So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?
JERRY: He should have had a reverse peephole.
JERRY: Hello? 
JERRY: So your saying UNICEF is a scam?
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: No, It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago . she's trying to become an actress.
JERRY: Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.
JERRY: She should just give up.
JERRY: So......Susan's dead.....
JERRY: Why'd you have to say anything to her?
JERRY: Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?
JERRY: What did you wanna be?
JERRY: I don't either.
JERRY: It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
JERRY: You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?
JERRY: She does not.
JERRY: Hey! 
JERRY: What! 
JERRY: Well, I got to talk her out of this.
JERRY: She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.
JERRY: Yeah...
JERRY: George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say,kookie talk.
JERRY: What are you doing? 
JERRY: You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.
JERRY: Yeah! 
JERRY: Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.
JERRY: You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? 
JERRY: Of course, I stink, you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks..
JERRY: All right, I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else.
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: Yeah. What does that mean?
JERRY: No....
JERRY: It's ludicrous..
JERRY: For either one of us..
JERRY: So...
JERRY: I'm not gay.
JERRY: Come on in here.
JERRY: What's happening? 
JERRY: Lets talk about that.
JERRY: Yeah right.
JERRY: Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.
JERRY: Well what does this mean?
JERRY: Kramer there's no way you stick to this.
JERRY: Oh! 
JERRY: Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a One-woman show?
JERRY: Ah! 
JERRY: Aw.. right, code of silence.. 
JERRY: (to Kramer) Oh! 
JERRY: Good luck, It's sold out for the next three weeks.
JERRY: The New Yorker?
JERRY: Wow! 
JERRY: Nodding off...
JERRY: Wow! 
JERRY: What, your sad little horsies, the house with the little curl of smoke, the sunflower with the smiley face. the transparent cube... (as she leaves)
JERRY: Where did you see that? 
JERRY: No,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.
JERRY: I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.
JERRY: You got a little shmootz there (picks something on her sweater)
JERRY: What a surprise.
JERRY: There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her
JERRY: I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.
JERRY: some mouthwash, a hat, something.
JERRY: (glances at it) Pretty good.
JERRY: It's a pig at a complain department.
JERRY: I get it.
JERRY: How 'bout if it was something like " I can't find my receipt my place's a stye.
JERRY: I'm a comedian.
JERRY: Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.
JERRY: oh! 
JERRY: Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally, yeah this is Jerry,I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and..
JERRY: ....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together.
JERRY: (from the back of the club, leaving) That's it I'm calling in the big guns.
JERRY: You ripped off a Ziggy?
JERRY: I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. "The New Yorker is stealing my ideas." ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real.
JERRY: Hey! 
JERRY: That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?
JERRY: Elaine, have you been talking to her?
JERRY: You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! 
JERRY: You mean like.. (points to his hair)
JERRY: So she..
JERRY: And you don't...
JERRY: So...
JERRY: Hmmmm...
JERRY: No, no......(long pause . they stare at the walls) Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?
JERRY: I think that's for the best.
JERRY: She said no?
JERRY: What did you do?
JERRY: George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments.
JERRY: That's good.
JERRY: Solid.
JERRY: Always popular.
JERRY: You have an airtight case!
JERRY: I'm afraid we're out of time.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie "Cinderfella". I got 'em at an auction.
JERRY: No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him.
JERRY: Oh, that'll intrigue him.
JERRY: George Peppard has been dead for years.
JERRY: What about Puddy?
JERRY: (unimpressed) So, what's this guy about?
JERRY: Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! 
JERRY: Green suit, power ring.
JERRY: So you bought a cooler?
JERRY: (doubtful) You were in the Army?
JERRY: No, go ahead.
JERRY: Oh, come on!
JERRY: (walking towards door with Elaine) How long did you last? 
JERRY: So, you would date a married guy? 
JERRY: Elaine, what are you doin' down there?
JERRY: Oh, I guess it's broken!
JERRY: It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.
JERRY: You'll chicken out at the last second.
JERRY: (annoyed) All right. (after a pause) Hey, you know what's weird?
JERRY: I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: Here! 
JERRY: Hey...
JERRY: (waving the key) You jammed your key in here? 
JERRY: I'm gonna go let Elaine in. (Kramer reaches out to stop him leaving)
JERRY: (in the hallway, hearing the door lock behind him, turns back) Kramer!
JERRY: Oh, hey. You got in.
JERRY: (taking the menus) Oh, thanks.
JERRY: So, he's definitely married, huh?
JERRY: Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.
JERRY: Oh, come on!
JERRY: (out of window) George, the buzzer's broken! 
JERRY: (putting on his coat to go downstairs, he finds the key in his coat pocket) I believe this belongs to you.
JERRY: (opens the door for George) Where did you get that?
JERRY: (barring the way) I'm sorry. I-I don't know you.
JERRY: There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.
JERRY: (shakes his head) I'm very sorry. (closing the door on Phil. Jerry smiles and shrugs apologetically as Phil stares at them through the glass)
JERRY: Great, you're lonely and miserable again. (presses button to call elevator)
JERRY: Is that guy still there? 
JERRY: Don't look at him. (Phil starts to knock on the door)
JERRY: We don't hear that. (They enter the elevator)
JERRY: Nooo, I don't. (the elevator doors shut)
JERRY: So you do live here.
JERRY: You live on this floor?
JERRY: (arriving at apartment, sees Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from Kramer's) So you live right... there.
JERRY: So I guess I'll s--
JERRY: Is he wretchedly poor? 
JERRY: So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?
JERRY: Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?
JERRY: Good. How did you handle that?
JERRY: Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.
JERRY: Hey, where have you been?
JERRY: We found out his super power was lack of money.
JERRY: He's invulnerable to creditors.
JERRY: He's the Got-no-Green Lantern.
JERRY: Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.
JERRY: (fidgets like he has no room with George next to him)... 
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: (to Elaine, still joking) He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!
JERRY: There's a giant parrot in the hallway.
JERRY: Who?
JERRY: What'd ya tell him that for?
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: He let you?
JERRY: Hi. Is Phil here?
JERRY: Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door.
JERRY: I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.
JERRY: (nodding awkwardly for a moment) All right, I think we're done here. (Jerry leaves and Phil shuts the door darkly)
JERRY: (in a tuxedo) So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a woman that won't have sex with you.
JERRY: I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!
JERRY: Where are you goin'? 
JERRY: Which is with who?
JERRY: I can't go until I find my cufflinks.
JERRY: You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?
JERRY: That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?
JERRY: Oh, Phil... Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry.
JERRY: But I, I didn't, I--
JERRY: Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! 
JERRY: Just get the key and let's get out of here.
JERRY: You killed Fredo!
JERRY: Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do?
JERRY: (frowning in realization) Oh, no!
JERRY: Kramer, I can't believe we're grave robbers.
JERRY: (seeing Fredo's tombstone) Oh, my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up! 
JERRY: (grimaces and takes the shovel back) I'll dig.
JERRY: (hitting metal with the first strike of the shovel) Well, that was easy.
JERRY: (with a wild expression) Hey, Kramer! 
JERRY: (after a very awkward pause, cheerily) Hey, neighbor.
JERRY: (still in tuxedo, tie undone) Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.
JERRY: You mean it was open? 
JERRY: It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.
JERRY: Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.
JERRY: Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.
JERRY: Susan's parents? 
JERRY: Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? 
JERRY: Still no Puddy?
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: Darryl. He's black, isn't he?
JERRY: Isn't he, Elaine?
JERRY: What's his last name?
JERRY: I think he's black.
JERRY: Why not?
JERRY: If he's black.
JERRY: Does it matter?
JERRY: Oh, so you need to know?
JERRY: (getting out his wallet) Uh, one second.
JERRY: House in the Hamptons?
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Wow. What are we celebrating?
JERRY: With the little legs?
JERRY: How much are they payin' you?
JERRY: That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.
JERRY: From what?
JERRY: (seeing that Kramer has a new watch) What's that?
JERRY: It's 5:30 in the morning!
JERRY: (handing his dad a gift) Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.
JERRY: What does that mean?
JERRY: Radar detector? 
JERRY: Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks.
JERRY: Could be.
JERRY: And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.
JERRY: Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.
JERRY: Kramer, what are you doing here?
JERRY: Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die.
JERRY: (getting looks from his parents) Not you. Older people.
JERRY: If you feed him, he'll never leave.
JERRY: I can't believe this.
JERRY: Dad, it's got lots of other functions.
JERRY: (looking at the Wizard) Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents.
JERRY: Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo.
JERRY: What press?
JERRY: She's fifty.
JERRY: (in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine) So did you figure out Darryl's... you know.
JERRY: (as Kramer walks by) You're a master of race relations.
JERRY: Yeah, it's all my father's doing.
JERRY: He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.
JERRY: Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.
JERRY: (overhearing the other two: Elaine, Elaine--
JERRY: (overhearing the other two) Oh, no.
JERRY: George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.
JERRY: This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.
JERRY: (in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room) Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad, you look so different.
JERRY: You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.
JERRY: Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.
JERRY: Wizards!
JERRY: Kramer...
JERRY: Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards.
JERRY: I didn't have a deal! 
JERRY: Down here?
JERRY: Aw.
JERRY: A Willard? 
JERRY: Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars.
JERRY: No deal. Not hot.
JERRY: Dad, I'm sorry.
JERRY: It does other things!
JERRY: And then?
JERRY: Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off.
JERRY: That's the way they do it in Vegas.
JERRY: I hear things.
JERRY: It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.
JERRY: Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.
JERRY: So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?
JERRY: No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.
JERRY: Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.
JERRY: Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.
JERRY: I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?
JERRY: Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker.
JERRY: What's with the fake sneezing?
JERRY: Do medical schools actually do this?
JERRY: I think the phone is ringing.
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: Elaine?
JERRY: Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.
JERRY: Ipecac? 
JERRY: Did he overdose?
JERRY: What did you do the rest of the day?
JERRY: And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
JERRY: No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?
JERRY: I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the "It's me" on the phone today.
JERRY: I thought so.
JERRY: No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.
JERRY: Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.
JERRY: Yes! 
JERRY: One message. Hope it's not from you.
JERRY: Sophie.
JERRY: Yep.
JERRY: I think that's a "what's good for the goose is good for the gander".
JERRY: (picking up the phone and dialing) It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.
JERRY: (to George) She thinks it's someone named Raef.
JERRY: (into the phone, with a disguised voice) So, what's going on?
JERRY: So, uh, how are things with Jerry?
JERRY: Right, right, the tractor story.
JERRY: I sound funny?
JERRY: Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! 
JERRY: She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.
JERRY: Beep, beep, beep? 
JERRY: No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.
JERRY: No, she looks completely normal.
JERRY: You think she's got toes for thumbs?
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: Why do I seek your counsel?
JERRY: That seems about right.
JERRY: Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--
JERRY: What do you care? 
JERRY: So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.
JERRY: Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.
JERRY: They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor.
JERRY: Losing? 
JERRY: Tractor!
JERRY: Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle.
JERRY: A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?
JERRY: I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.
JERRY: She doesn't have toe thumbs.
JERRY: Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?
JERRY: Never.
JERRY: Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.
JERRY: (putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to Sopie's) Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship.
JERRY: Hey, hey! 
JERRY: (walking out) Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody.
JERRY: First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.
JERRY: (Sarcastic) You better hurry.
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.
JERRY: She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?
JERRY: (Pointing) Hey, there's Leo.
JERRY: Uncle Leo.
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.
JERRY: (Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 'French Impressionist Paintings'?
JERRY: (Cutting him off) Thank you very much.
JERRY: I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.
JERRY: Sleeping in the caragain?
JERRY: (Remembering) Oh, right. The big party..
JERRY: (Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything?
JERRY: (Confused) What's your position?
JERRY: (Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?
JERRY: (Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not.
JERRY: (Still skeptical) No, he doesn't.
JERRY: Yes, it can.
JERRY: So, who's gonna pull this thing?
JERRY: (Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My, isn't this an awkward moment?
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.
JERRY: So, Leo, how's everything? 
JERRY: (Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about money? 
JERRY: (Being frank) Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.
JERRY: Because you were too busy stealing a book.
JERRY: (Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal.
JERRY: Who, criminals?
JERRY: You could get arrested.
JERRY: (Pleading) Leo..
JERRY: (Thinking he's stopped Leo's thefts) Thank you.
JERRY: (To himself) I don't believe this! 
JERRY: (Pointing) He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..
JERRY: '51-50'? 
JERRY: (To Guard) I just wanted you to scare him.
JERRY: (Unsure of what to say - he remember's Leo's courtesy tip) Hello?
JERRY: Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.
JERRY: (Scoffing) Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.
JERRY: (Not believeing it) Prior convictions? 
JERRY: (Confused) What does that mean?
JERRY: Mom, you too?
JERRY: Alright, I'll talk to you later.
JERRY: (Joking around) Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.
JERRY: To the Idiotmobile!
JERRY: So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?
JERRY: (Butting in) Tina Turner?
JERRY: Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
JERRY: (Stern on George) Not underpants.
JERRY: (Getting up) Uncle Leo. Hello!
JERRY: (Trying to explain) Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past.
JERRY: (Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo, wait! 
JERRY: Leo's furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at George's book) What is that doing on the table?
JERRY: (Pointing) I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.
JERRY: That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and-
JERRY: I don't read in the bathroom.
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: Uncle Leo?
JERRY: Nightmares. You?
JERRY: You're not feeding him, are you?
JERRY: (Scared) Ah! 
JERRY: Get out of here!
JERRY: I want everyone out!
JERRY: (Bitter) Good night, Newman.
JERRY: (To Elaine) So, the worst is over?
JERRY: Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.
JERRY: (To cashier) I'd like to speak with the manager, please.
JERRY: George? 
JERRY: (Sarcasticly joking) It certainly has.
JERRY: (Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?
JERRY: Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..
JERRY: (Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.
JERRY: So it could be anyone?
JERRY: That guy! 
JERRY: What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
JERRY: Why aren't you there now?
JERRY: You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.
JERRY: Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?
JERRY: They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
JERRY: Where did you get this?
JERRY: You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?
JERRY: So they just gave you this?
JERRY: How come I haven't read about this?
JERRY: Son of dad?
JERRY: We used to come in every day.
JERRY: All right, make it the large sodas.
JERRY: Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.
JERRY: Hey, look at the high score--"G.L.C." George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?
JERRY: I remember that night.
JERRY: I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
JERRY: I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--
JERRY: Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--
JERRY: Not as long.
JERRY: Get going.
JERRY: Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--
JERRY: Actually, that's--
JERRY: Right.
JERRY: Sure. (points at booth) How about this one?
JERRY: Fabulous. See, now you're really do something.
JERRY: Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?
JERRY: Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.
JERRY: Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.
JERRY: Another friend?
JERRY: Come on.
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.
JERRY: What is that?
JERRY: So join in.
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: Hey, wh-what--
JERRY: Well Lisi, that was another-
JERRY: Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--
JERRY: Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?
JERRY: Riverside Park.
JERRY: Back to my place. That's right.
JERRY: She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.
JERRY: Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--
JERRY: How'd it taste?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Pennsylvania Dutch country? 
JERRY: Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.
JERRY: Well, I'm calling this off right now.
JERRY: Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.
JERRY: Hi, Lisi.
JERRY: Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something.
JERRY: Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.
JERRY: Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?
JERRY: Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do.
JERRY: Have we even been in public?
JERRY: You are not dumb. Don't say that..
JERRY: These beans are pretty good.
JERRY: Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!
JERRY: Nice to meet ya!
JERRY: Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? 
JERRY: We've been breaking up for 10 hours?
JERRY: Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day.
JERRY: Lopper.
JERRY: Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! 
JERRY: No. I'm waiting for...
JERRY: Oh. Sounds great.
JERRY: Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend.
JERRY: Great. Uh, you know what? 
JERRY: A long, long weekend.
JERRY: Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.
JERRY: By yourself?
JERRY: Game over.
JERRY: I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.
JERRY: Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
JERRY: You mean like...Liza!
JERRY: But there's no "t" in your name. What about G-bone?
JERRY: There's a g-spot.
JERRY: T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya.
JERRY: They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
JERRY: Oh, I had that comin' to me.
JERRY: You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
JERRY: I hired her from a service!
JERRY: Thank you. Nice job.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Notice what? 
JERRY: She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.
JERRY: You have a girlfriend?
JERRY: At a rodeo. Where's she moving?
JERRY: It's like 10 minutes by subway.
JERRY: That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.
JERRY: Here we go.
JERRY: And a dead bolt.
JERRY: Well Cindy, the place looks great.
JERRY: Ok, I'll see ya.
JERRY: Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?
JERRY: No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
JERRY: I was going to say, "Being a good host."
JERRY: But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.
JERRY: Yes, I do.
JERRY: Yes, we have.
JERRY: The store.
JERRY: Stuff.
JERRY: And gum.
JERRY: She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
JERRY: Kramer, you're still on the phone?
JERRY: Really? 
JERRY: Madeline stays here.
JERRY: Hey, T-bone!
JERRY: No T-bone?
JERRY: No! 
JERRY: Why no T-bone?
JERRY: Yes.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: Yeah. It's in your closet.
JERRY: They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
JERRY: Where you goin'?
JERRY: Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.
JERRY: What did I just pay for?
JERRY: Koko?
JERRY: Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.
JERRY: Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.
JERRY: No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.
JERRY: 40.
JERRY: I don't know what this is.
JERRY: Ooh.
JERRY: I look about the same.
JERRY: I was talking to him.
JERRY: Never mind.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Go back.
JERRY: I said, never mind.
JERRY: I hate the counter.
JERRY: Hey.
JERRY: Oh, she didn't mind?
JERRY: Hey, that's great.
JERRY: Elaine got a new number because she died.
JERRY: Some new kind of pie.
JERRY: Hey, there's a booth.
JERRY: So how's it goin' at work? 
JERRY: Double zero?
JERRY: Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.
JERRY: Good-bye, Koko.
JERRY: Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you.
JERRY: I didn't hear anything.
JERRY: Oh, right! 
JERRY: For what?
JERRY: But you didn't really do any work.
JERRY: But you took a nap in it.
JERRY: I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
JERRY: Well, who took the nap?
JERRY: $40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
JERRY: Ho, ho...ho! 
JERRY: So is this a breakup/quitting?
JERRY: Oh, yeah? 
JERRY: So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? 
JERRY: Miss.
JERRY: I wouldn't worry about it. B-6?
JERRY: Elaine...
JERRY: Hello?
JERRY: I accept.
JERRY: Well, what happened?
JERRY: What's around you?
JERRY: Is it Famous Ray's?
JERRY: Famous Original Ray's?
JERRY: Well, what street are you on?
JERRY: Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Cindy.
JERRY: You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do.
JERRY: Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? 
JERRY: Nexus of the universe. Hey, Cindy. Cindy.
JERRY: Here. I got your money.
JERRY: Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.
JERRY: Well, this is all very sophisticated.
JERRY: Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.
JERRY: I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
JERRY: Keep your shirt on. I got it.
JERRY: Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
JERRY: Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.
JERRY: How was it?
JERRY: Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.
JERRY: Heh.
JERRY: Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
JERRY: What is that music?
JERRY: Oh, no.
JERRY: It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!
JERRY: See? 
JERRY: I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.
JERRY: But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?
JERRY: All right, I'm worming.
JERRY: They're not letting me in.
JERRY: Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.
JERRY: The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.
JERRY: One more lane to go.
JERRY: Maroon Golf.
JERRY: Could you move your car back a little?
JERRY: You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.
JERRY: Can you believe her?
JERRY: Where are you going?
JERRY: You're going to that again? 
JERRY: That's not what I do.
JERRY: Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.
JERRY: I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.
JERRY: Walk away?
JERRY: Isn't there a deductible?
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: From what?
JERRY: We're not leaving the car!
JERRY: Absolutely not. He sped up.
JERRY: I'm ready to talk.
JERRY: What's that?
JERRY: Ok!
JERRY: What's that on your forehead?
JERRY: Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?
JERRY: See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.
JERRY: I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! 
JERRY: So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? 
JERRY: Not you! 
JERRY: Elaine, he doesn't need-
JERRY: 'Cause that's what's gonna happen.
JERRY: I don't know.
JERRY: Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.
JERRY: Hey, there's the soda guy.
JERRY: What seems to be the problem, officer?
JERRY: At me?
JERRY: Oh. It's back.
JERRY: What if it gets in the side?
JERRY: Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-
JERRY: Oh. It's in your eye now.
JERRY: Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!
JERRY: You were watchin'? 
JERRY: Oh, that was a strike! 
JERRY: Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?
JERRY: Not Pennypacker!
JERRY: I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!
JERRY: Oh, hello...
JERRY: Mr. Vandelay, of course.
JERRY: Pennypacker.
JERRY: Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?
JERRY: The Saab factory?
JERRY: My car!
JERRY: I love a parade!
JERRY: Well, what about my car?
JERRY: Hey, there's Elaine.
JERRY: Well, you look, uh...relaxed.
JERRY: Well, at least he didn't-
JERRY: Somebody remember where we parked.
JERRY: I know what you mean.
JERRY: It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
JERRY: Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.
JERRY: So what are you doing later? 
JERRY: To see a movie.
JERRY: Not this movie.
JERRY: Did you shower today?
JERRY: That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
JERRY: Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.
JERRY: What is that?
JERRY: Ey, ey!
JERRY: Nothing.
JERRY: Have a good time.
JERRY: You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?
JERRY: Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
JERRY: Faux pas.
JERRY: You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."
JERRY: It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
JERRY: It's pompous.
JERRY: Hey - hey - hey!
JERRY: Where do you think this relationship is? 
JERRY: Uptight? 
JERRY: Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? 
JERRY: He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about "Jerry."
JERRY: Right.
JERRY: Yeah!
JERRY: Today, like right now.
JERRY: "Jerry"!
JERRY: He wants to talk about "Jerry"!
JERRY: "Jerry"!
JERRY: Sure!
JERRY: Forget the sports jacket.
JERRY: You're not a writer.
JERRY: Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.
JERRY: Don't blow this.
JERRY: If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.
JERRY: He might not want nothing.
JERRY: He might want a show about anything and everything.
JERRY: All right.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Good, good. You remember George.
JERRY: Don't spell.
JERRY: Shut up, George.
JERRY: Oy.
JERRY: Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?
JERRY: Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than "coffee machine show."
JERRY: But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
JERRY: He's a little off the wall.
JERRY: Definitely.
JERRY: Yeah!
JERRY: Hi. Elaine, it's me.
JERRY: No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
JERRY: The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show! 
JERRY: Did you hear what I said?
JERRY: Jill? 
JERRY: So now she's lost a phone face-off? 
JERRY: Yeah, it's pretty good.
JERRY: NBC is letting me use their private jet? 
JERRY: Hey - how was the beach?
JERRY: I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
JERRY: So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, "Jerry"? 
JERRY: Yeah, only for a while.
JERRY: No, I'll be back.
JERRY: And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.
JERRY: Anywhere.
JERRY: I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.
JERRY: Russia, it's so bleak.
JERRY: It's still bleak.
JERRY: You can be bleak in spring.
JERRY: Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything. Why don't we all just go to Paris?
JERRY: So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.
JERRY: Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation.
JERRY: First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?
JERRY: Hello, Newman. What gives?
JERRY: Yeah, that's right.
JERRY: Really.
JERRY: That's a shame.
JERRY: Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: All set. We'll just grab the bags.
JERRY: Just keeps on getting better and better.
JERRY: Not bad.
JERRY: You're complaining about a private jet?
JERRY: Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
JERRY: You're not writing any letters!
JERRY: Still got water in your ear?
JERRY: Kramer, what the hell did you do?
JERRY: Kramer!
JERRY: Is this it? 
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: What? 
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Why?
JERRY: Great - I won.
JERRY: Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.
JERRY: Alright.
JERRY: We're straightening out!
JERRY: Where are we?
JERRY: Okay.
JERRY: We'll see you later.
JERRY: I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.
JERRY: Alright, I'll feel him out.
JERRY: Another one?
JERRY: Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
JERRY: That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.
JERRY: Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.
JERRY: No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.
JERRY: Under arrest? 
JERRY: Oh, yeah.
JERRY: But then we would have missed the whole thing.
JERRY: I forgot about the video.
JERRY: Plane's ready.
JERRY: You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.
JERRY: It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
JERRY: Good morning.
JERRY: No.
JERRY: This one?
JERRY: Do I have to?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
JERRY: Gimme that rye.
JERRY: I want that rye lady.
JERRY: Shut up, you old bag!
JERRY: The virgin!
JERRY: Who the hell is that?
JERRY: That's right, the Bubble Boy.
JERRY: He's a boy who lives in a bubble.
JERRY: Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? 
JERRY: Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
JERRY: Who?
JERRY: Medium crab bisque.
JERRY: Just forget it. Let it go.
JERRY: How did they find Babu?
JERRY: Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
JERRY: It's not that bright orange one is it?
JERRY: Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?
JERRY: Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
JERRY: What?
JERRY: Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back
JERRY: Sure.
JERRY: I think that would be a very nice gesture.
JERRY: See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.
JERRY: Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land.
JERRY: You think?
JERRY: Yeah, maybe we have.
JERRY: So what is the deal with the yard? 
JERRY: I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?
JERRY: Murder one? 
JERRY: Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.
JERRY: Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand.
JERRY: Alright, hey, you've been great!
